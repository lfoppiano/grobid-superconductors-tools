PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	This ensures numerically stable calculations in external fields up to at least 5 T, even at ε aa ¼ ε v .	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	The impact of the reduced Hund's coupling appears to produce systematic errors in related absolute parameters but less so for the relative changes induced by strain.	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	For example, for the selected scaling, indicates that the calculated χ DFT s ðε aa ¼ 0Þ renormalization is approximately 1.6, whereas the known correlation-induced mass enhancement is about 3.5 .	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the downscaling is too strong.	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	Given this caveat, at the critical strain, χ DFT s ðε aa ¼ ε v Þ is enhanced over χ DFT s ðε aa ¼ 0Þ by about 70%, while Sðε v Þ itself is enhanced by a much smaller factor, about 30% over Sð0Þ [right frame of ].	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	The scaling for the shifts should follow approximately these factors.	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	Namely, the enhancement of K 1k is expected to scale with χ s , and therefore, of order 70%, whereas the enhancement of K 1 0 ⊥ being sensitive to enhancement of S is expected to be much smaller, of order 30%.	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	The former enhancement matches the data in well, as well as the calculations presented in .	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	The latter enhancement of 30% is relatively larger than the experimental results [], as well as the calculations [], which are both ≃10%.	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	The discrepancy could be associated with unaccounted-for nonsingular contributions, such as in an orbital part (van Vleck or induced through spin-orbit coupling), or nonlinearities, as documented in .	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the qualitative conclusions from the experiments and in comparing to the DFT calculations are as follows: (1) There are two mechanisms for enhancing the Knight shifts near the critical strain, one applicable to all sites and field directions and the other only to K 1k .	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	Both are directly related to the DOS enhancement and show unambiguously that the maximum in T c indeed coincides with that in DOS.	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	(2) Ferromagnetic spin fluctuations intensify substantially at the same strain due to Stoner enhancement.	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	This effect may also play a key role in boosting T c. The nonlinear magnetic response for ε aa ≃ ε v and at low temperatures and magnetic fields appears to deviate from the expected single-particle response and are offered here as evidence for both the enhancement of the spin fluctuations, as well as the proximity to a ferromagnetic instability.	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	Expanding further on point (3) above, the straindependent enhancement of S provides a natural explanation to the recently reported resistivity measurements on stressed samples in which deviations from standard Fermi-liquid behavior were observed and interpreted in terms of the DOS singularity .	0

PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	In principle, one would expect similar behavior to that for the in-plane field; however, it appears that K c behaves in a way difficult to rationalize in total.	0

PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	Interestingly, for the orbital part of K 1c , and to some extent, of K 1 0 c , the calculations predict a sizeable enhancement, suggesting that the van Vleck contribution is not dominant, or, at least, less prominent here than for the in-plane fields, and, conversely, the SOC induces sizeable orbital Knight shifts.	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	Moreover, the sign of this orbital contribution is the opposite of the spin shifts, so there is a tendency toward cancellation.	0

PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	We demonstrate by means of the NMR spectroscopy under uniaxial stress and corresponding density-functional calculations that there are two different effects associated with the strain-induced VHS, which both need to be taken into account, namely, the enhancement of the DOS associated with the γ-band Fermi energy passing through the VHS at the Y point of the Brillouin zone, and a substantial Stoner enhancement S. Associated with the enhanced S is an intensification of ferromagnetic spin fluctuations and strong nonlinearities in the spin susceptibility to the lowest temperatures studied.	0
PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	This finding has immediate ramifications for superconductivity.	0

PhysRevX.9.021044.superconductors.tei.xml	Overall, in the in the α and β bands, the local Stoner factor (the enhancement of the exchange splitting of the electronic states) varies between 3.2 and 4.7 , and in the γ band it is between 5.7 and 10.0, about a factor of 2 larger than for the unstrained structure.	0

SSC1310125-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It was also noted that the pH value increases from 9.0 at the beginning of the hydration to 12.0 when the reaction completed.	0

SSC1310125-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	One would expect that relatively weak Coulomb attractions along the c-axis for Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 · 0.85H 2 O due to the relatively less electric charge in the Na + and CoO 2 layers.	0

L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Very recent µSR [5] and NMR [6] experiments revealed that unconventional superconductivity is realized, particularly in KOs 2 O 6 with the highest T c .	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In contrast, there are a few reports insisting on conventional BCS-type superconductivity in RbOs 2 O 6 [7, 8].	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Concerning the normal-state properties, the temperature dependence of resistivity shows T 2 behavior at low temperature for every compound, implying that electron correlations are sufficiently strong to stabilize a Fermi liquid state.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The coefficient A of the T 2 term in resistivity is larger in KOs 2 O 6 than in CsOs 2 O 6 and RbOs 2 O 6 .	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Moreover, it is found that the Sommerfeld coefficient γ from specific heat measurements is nearly equal for the Cs and Rb compounds, γ = 20 mJ/K 2 molOs [9], while it is much larger for KOs 2 O 6 [10].	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Hence there must be a large mass enhancement toward KOs 2 O 6 due to electron correlations.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The superconducting transition temperature of the β-pyrochlore oxides increases with decreasing the ionic radius of A-site alkali metals from Cs to K. Accordingly, the lattice volume is decreased by the negative chemical pressure.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This fact implies that the reduction of the lattice volume by applying physical pressure would further enhance T c .	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This expectation was confirmed actually in previous two high-pressure (HP) experiments by measuring magnetization up to 1.2 GPa for all the members [11] and up to 0.8 GPa for RbOs 2 O 6 [7].	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Another interesting finding in the former study is that only in the case of KOs 2 O 6 the T c exhibits a saturation around 0.6 GPa and then decreases slightly with pressure, suggesting complicated pressure dependences at higher pressures.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, it is important to investigate the pressure dependence of T c and other properties in a wider pressure range.	0

L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The coexistence of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 may not affect the determination of T c , because it becomes insulating below 230 K [13].	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Electrical resistivity measurements were performed by the four-probe method in a cubic-anvil press apparatus [14] at high pressures from 2 GPa to 10 GPa and temperatures from 3 K to 300 K. A fluorinert liquid, which is a one-to-one mixture of FC-70 and FC-77 (3M TM ), was used as a pressure transmitting medium.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A polycrystalline pellet of a typical size of 0.8 × 0.3 × 0.4 mm 3 was immersed into the fluorinert liquid in a cylindrical teflon capsule of 1.5 φ × 1.8 mm 3 size.	0

L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The slope of the T 2 term in RbOs 2 O 6 is large at 2 GPa and does not change much up to 3 GPa near the T c maximum.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Then it decreases very much from 4 GPa to 7 GPa, where T c decreases and finally disappears, and then increases again at 8 GPa and 10 GPa.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The origin of an upturn observed at low temperatures above 7 GPa is not known and it is ignored in evaluating A and ρ 0 .	0

L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In order to deduce a general trend, each quantity has been normalized by the value at the maximum of the T c dome.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Pressure is also normalized as P n = ( P -P* ) / ( P c -P* ), where P* is a pressure at the T c maximum and P c is a critical pressure where superconductivity disappears; that is, P n = 0 for P = P* and P n = 1 for P = P c .	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For KOs 2 O 6 , only T c is plotted, because we could not obtain reliable data due to the presence of impurities.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It becomes apparent now that normalized T c falls on a universal curve.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Either normalized A and ρ 0 is connected smoothly between RbOs 2 O 6 and CsOs 2 O 6 to show a general curve: Normalized A exhibits a broad maximum near the T c maximum and a minimum near P c , while normalized ρ 0 shows a minimum near P* and a maximum near P c .	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the framework of Fermi liquid theory, A is proportional to square of effective mass of carriers or density of states at the Fermi level.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, the above results on A imply that the carrier mass is enhanced significantly at the T c maximum owing to correlation effects.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This strongly suggests that the mechanism of superconductivity in the β-pyrochlore 4 oxides is relevant to electron correlations.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, residual resistivity is generally expressed by the equation ρ 0 = ( ħ / e 2 l ) ( 3 π 2 ) 1/3 n -2/3 , where l is the mean free path of carriers and n is carrier density.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The mean free path at low temperature may be determined by the concentration of impurities or defects and thus should not be affected by pressure.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is expected, however, that the mean free path would be reduced largely by quantum fluctuations developing toward absolute zero, which often exist near a quantum critical point associated with a certain long-range order such as a magnetic transition or valence transition [16,17].	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The observed enhancement in ρ 0 near P c may indicate that there is an unknown long-range order at higher pressure.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Possibly, the sudden recovery of metallic behavior observed below 100 K at 10 GPa in RbOs 2 O 6 (Fig.3(b) is related to this long range order.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is plausible that the associated quantum fluctuations would suppress the superconductivity, giving rise to a dome-shaped T c variation.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The observed dome-shaped change in T c and the corresponding unusual variations in A and ρ 0 must reflect unconventional features of superconductivity in the β-pyrochlore oxides.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, it seems that they are quite different from those observed in well-known unconventional superconductors, such as f-electron intermetallic compounds or low-dimensional organic conductors [12,18].	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A typical f-electron compound CeCu 2 Ge 2 exhibits a large reduction in A and a sharp peak in ρ 0 at the T c maximum, which is believed to be induced by valence fluctuations [12,16,17].	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the present β-pyrochlores osmium ions are formally in a 5.5 valent state with two and a half 5d electrons.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is interesting to note that this number of 5d electrons is just between two integer values for Re 5+ ions (5d 2 ) in 1 K superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 and Os 5+ ions (5d 3 ) in Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 exhibiting a metal-to-insulator transition [13, 19].	1
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, we think that valence fluctuations may not play a primary role in the β-pyrochlores, because the band width of Os 5d -O 2p hybridized bands is large, ~3 eV, from the band structure calculations [20-22].	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The most plausible scenario for quantum fluctuations is to assume electronic instability associated with Fermi surface nesting.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Harima has pointed out that an important general feature on the band structure of the β-pyrochlores is the existence of a pair of Fermi surfaces of nearly octahedral shape which forms a thin shell centered at the Γ point.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, strong Fermi surface nesting and resulting spin-density-wave instability are expected.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Moreover, a 'dimple' grows on the octahedral Fermi surface from K to Cs, suggesting that the nesting becomes weaker along this line.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It would be interesting to test how this feature changes under high pressure.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In order to clarify the existence of possible quantum fluctuations in the β-pyrochlore oxides and their relevance to the superconductivity, further experiments are required under high pressures.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In summary, we have obtained interesting and characteristic behavior in the pressure dependence of T c and other parameters in the β-pyrochlore oxides AOs 2 O 6 by measuring resistivity under high pressure up to 10 GPa.	0

L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The T c is defined as the midpoint of the transition.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The most dramatic change in T c with pressure is observed in (a) for CsOs 2 O 6 with the lowest T c = 3.3 K at AP.	1
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The T c is already raised to 5.0 K at 2 GPa and further increased to 7.6 K at 6 GPa.	1
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Then, it turns to decrease at higher pressures and finally reaches to 3.7 K at 10 GPa.	1
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is also to be noted that the resistivity just above T c varies markedly with pressure: It first decreases and then increases with increasing pressure.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the case of RbOs 2 O 6 , as shown in , the T c at 2 GPa is 8.2 K, raised from 6.3 K at AP.	1
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is reduced gradually with further increasing pressure, and at last no drops in resistivity are observed above 7 GPa down to 4.2 K. Probably, the superconducting transition is suppressed above a critical pressure P c ~ 7 GPa.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the case of KOs 2 O 6 with the highest T c of 9.6 K at AP ), the T c is reduced to 8.2 K at 2.0 GPa, 5.7 K at 4.0 GPa, and disappears above that.	1
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In both cases, the resistivity above T c is enhanced enormously with increasing pressure.	0

L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, the positions of the maximum are quite different among them: (P*/GPa, T c */K) = (6.0, 7.6), (2.0, 8.2) and (0.6, 10) for Cs, Rb and K, respectively.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Critical pressures P c , where superconductivity is suppressed, are also different; P c ~ 6 and 7 GPa for K and Rb, and more than 10 GPa for Cs.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	These differences in P* and P c must come from differences in the lattice constant and its compressibility under high pressure.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The lattice constant becomes smaller from Cs to K, and the compressibility also becomes smaller in the same direction .	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, it is plausible to assume that the T c of AOs 2 O 6 exhibits a general dome-shaped dependence on the lattice volume.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The enhancement in T c at AP from Cs to K is ascribed to the smaller lattice volume.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, the observed difference in T c* among the three compounds must come from another degree of freedom.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Possibly, it is related to the only one crystallographic parameter of the β-pyrochlore structure, which is the x parameter of the 48f oxygen.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This parameter determines the magnitude of a trigonal distortion for OsO 6 octahedra and thus may influence the band structures of the β-pyrochlroe oxides.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Among the three compounds, RbOs 2 O 6 would provide us with a suitable playground to study the pressure dependence of resistivity in detail, because the entire range of the T c dome, as well as a non-superconducting regime, can be examined in one system.	0

L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This reduction of resistivity near room temperature probably is not intrinsic but may come from the compression of grains in the polycrystalline sample used in this work.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In contrast, the enhancement of the low temperature resistivity must be intrinsic and implies that the residual resistivity is increased with pressure.	0
L095167004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, in the pressure range between 4 and 7 GPa which corresponds to the right half of the T c dome, a remarkable change in resistivity is observed as shown in .	0

L094127001-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Analysis of the asymmetry time spectra showed that below T c in the present SLCO sample more than 80 % of the muons stop in the superconducting regions (first component).	0
L094127001-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this regions the internal magnetic field is smaller than the external one because of the diamagnetic screening and the depolarization rate is much higher than in the normal state because of the flux-line lattice formation.	0
L094127001-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The rest 20 % of the muons (second component) oscillate with a frequency nearly equal to that corresponding to the applied magnetic field with a much smaller depolarization rate.	0

SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Here, to explain the absence of superconductivity we recognize the following two plausible reasons: (i) Co and Cu are partly intermixed such that the content of Co in the CuO 2 plane is high enough to kill superconductivity , and (ii) holes induced by Ca substitution are not directed into the CuO 2 plane but are (mostly) located in the CoO 1+δ charge reservoir.	0

SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	To be able to reach the correct answer, we first investigated whether the pure high-pressure (HP) effect alone would induce superconductivity in the Ca-substituted CoSr 2 (Y 1-x Ca x )Cu 2 O 7+δ samples.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As-synthesized powder with x = 0.4 was annealed without Ag 2 O 2 at 5 GPa and 500 o C for 30 min, i.e. under the condition otherwise the same as that employed for the HPO samples except that no excess oxygen source was added.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Superconductivity did not show for this HP sample.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Furthermore, upon the HP annealing the lattice parameters of the AS sample as well as the χ vs. T behavior (see for the x = 0.4 case) remained unchanged.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is thus concluded that both the drastic decrease in the lattice parameters, b and c, and the appearance of superconductivity upon high-pressure annealing have resulted from the application of high oxygen partial pressure during annealing.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Next we annealed the HPO-superconducterized x = 0.4 sample in flowing N 2 gas.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This annealing was carried out in a thermobalance (Perkin Elmer: Pyris 1) in order to be able to thermogravimetrically (TG) follow changes in the sample weight occurring during the annealing.	0

SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From the XRD pattern for the HPO-N 2 sample it was concluded that the N 2 annealing made the lattice parameters of the Co-1212 phase to recover back to the same values as those of the AS sample before the HPO annealing.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, the amount of Ag seen in the XRD pattern did not visibly increase as compared to that seen for the HPO sample.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, it is likely that the weight/oxygen loss detected by TG upon N 2 annealing is primarily due to the Co-1212 phase itself.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This conclusion is supported by the magnetization data: upon annealing the HPO sample in N 2 not only superconductivity but also the magnetic transition characteristically seen for all the HPO samples around 150 K disappeared ).	0

SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The second, smaller weight step in the TG curve about 300 o C well coincides with that seen for the decomposition of pure Ag 2 O [23].	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We thus assign the second step for the decomposition of leftover Ag 2 O, i.e. y ≈ 0.4, and the first step only to the oxygen evolution from the Co-1212 phase, i.e. δ ≈ 0.4.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As the final step of the present work we checked the optimum amount of Ag 2 O 2 used as a source of excess oxygen in the HPO annealing.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The first HPO treatments were all carried out with 50 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 .	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Here we made ad hoc HPO annealings for the x = 0.4 sample using 25 and 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 .	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It was found that with 25 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 , the c axis decreased less as compared with the case of 50 mol-%.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	More importantly, the sample did not show superconductivity.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, with 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 peaks due to Ag 2 O appeared in the XRD pattern for the HPO annealed sample.	1
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The annealed sample exhibited superconductivity with a lower T c value of 20 K than that of the HPO annealed product with 50 mol-% of Ag 2 O 2 (T c ≈ 35 K).	1
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It was thus revealed that the optimum amount of Ag 2 O 2 as an oxygen source for the HPO annealing is in the vicinity of 50 mol-%.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Here it should also be noted that we annealed the two new HPO samples in a thermobalance in N 2 .	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From the TG curves shown in Fig. 6 together with that for the sample with 50 % Ag 2 O 2 we could see the following features: the second weight-loss step about 300 o C that we had previously assigned to the decomposition of leftover Ag 2 O was not seen at all for the HPO sample with 25 % Ag 2 O 2 (y ≈ 0), whereas it was more pronounced for that with 100 % Ag 2 O 2 (y ≈ 1.0) in comparison with the original HPO sample with 50 % Ag 2 O 2 (y ≈ 0.4).	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The amount of oxygen depleted from the Co-1212 phase in the first weight-loss step increased with increasing amount of Ag 2 O 2 used for the HPO annealing, i.e. In conclusion, we have systematically clarified the influence of aliovalent Ca II -for-Y III substitution and high-pressure-oxygen annealing on the superconductivity of CoSr 2 (Y 1-x Ca x )Cu 2 O 7+δ (Co-1212) samples.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It was found that at least up to x ≈ 0.4 Ca dissolves in the Co-1212 phase at the Y site.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Within this range of Ca substitution the oxygen content of as-synthesized samples remained stoichiometric.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore we could assure that holes were gradually doped in the Co-1212 structure upon Ca substitution.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The as-synthesized samples, however, were not superconductive, suggesting that the holes created by the divalent-for-trivalent substitution are trapped about the Co atom in the charge reservoir.	0
SSC1270493-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The combination of Ca substitution and high-pressure-oxygen annealing was necessary to induce superconductivity in the Co-1212 phase.	0

SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The strong anisotropic nature of HTSC is believed to be a reflection of this weak interlayer coupling.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this context, the infinite-layer compounds ACuO 2 (A = alkaline-earth ions) are remarkable, because they do not have a CRB, so the simplicity of their crystal structure may allow in-depth insight into the basic mechanism of cuprate superconductivity.	0

SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this work, we measured the reversible magnetization as a function of the temperature and the angle between the c axis and the applied magnetic field.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From analysis of the data, we found that the usual HTSC two-dimensional (2D) temperature region of ξ c (T ) < c below T c did not exist in this compound.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This peculiar feature has not been observed in any other high-T c material.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Until now, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (Y-123) has been known to have the most strong interlayer coupling, but the three-dimensional (3D) temperature region is limited to near T c only.	0

SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In comparison with other cuprates, our data show two interesting features.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	First, the curves shift to lower temperature as the field increases and are almost parallel to each other.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This typical mean-field behavior is consistent with the prediction of the Abrikosov model in which the magnetization scales linearly with the magnetic field.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Such a feature has never been observed before for any high-T c cuprate because the mean-field behavior is usually screened by strong thermal fluctuations.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Secondly, the rate of decrease of T c (H) with respect to the field is significantly larger than that of other cuprates, here the superconducting transition temperature, T c (H), is estimated as the temperature at the point of intersection of a linear extrapolation of 4πM (T ) in the superconducting state with the normal-state base line of 4πM = 0.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For instance, at H = 5 T, T c (H) is found to be about 33 K, which corresponds to 0.77T c (0).	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Hence, the upper-critical field H c2 (0) is expected to be about 20 T, assuming a linear T c (H).	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	To determine H c2 (0) precisely, we apply the Hao-Clem model for reversible magnetization to our data.	0

SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, we judge our result not to be model dependent particularly from the following consideration: The open symbols in the inset of represent the in-plane magnetic penetration depth, λ ab (T ), obtained from the dc-magnetic susceptibility, 4πχ(T ), for the low-field region of H < H c1 .	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	To deduce λ ab (T ) from the 4πχ(T ) curve, we use the Shoenberg formula, which is not model dependent, but is merely based on the London equations.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For comparison, we also plot λ ab (T ) (filled symbols) from the Hao-Clem analysis in the same figure.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We can see that the two curves, indeed, coincide.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, we can conclude that the application of the Hao-Clem model in this study does not reduce the generality of our results.	0

SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The estimated zero-temperature penetration depth, λ ab (0), is 147 ± 6 nm, which is close to λ ab (0) ≃ 130 nm of Y-123.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the framework of the London model, the penetration depth is proportional to (m * ab /n s ) 1/2 , where m * and n s are the electronic effective mass in the ab plane and the charge-carrier density, respectively.	0

SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For moderately anisotropic materials like Y-123, a broader 3D-temperature region around T c was observed due to strong interlayer coupling.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, the 3D region for strongly anisotropic compounds, such as Bi-and Tlbased superconductors, was found to be extremely narrow.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since the unit structure of an infinite-layer superconductor does not contain a CRB, one can expect the coupling between CuO 2 planes to be strong.	0

SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We see a good fit, except for temperatures above T = 39 K. We infer that the departure of the data from the theoretical lines at higher temperatures is due to the thermal fluctuation effect, which becomes more important as the temperature increases.	0

SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The increase is postulated to originate from the thermal fluctuation effect, as mentioned above.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the open-symbol set, however, no such plateau feature exists.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In fact, the London model is known to be suitable for the low-field region of H ≪ H c2 .	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since our magnetization data were taken near the transition temperature, the external field of 1 T is regarded as considerably large.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, our data set is out of the London region.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is consistent with the 4πM (T ) data in , which lie in the Abrikosov region.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is quite natural to take the value of the plateau in the filled-symbol set as the real anisotropy ratio.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	With this value, γ = 9.3 ± 0.2, we obtain an out-of-plane coherence length of ξ c (0) = 5.2 ± 0.3Å by using the relationship ξ c = ξ ab /γ and the value of ξ ab (0) from the above analysis.	0

SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This value is somewhat larger than the value of γ ≃ 5 for Y-123.	0
SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, the absence of a CRB in the infinite-layer compound allows the order parameter of one layer to overlap with those of neighboring layers.	0

EPL0580589-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Extrapolating T * to the overdoped phase suggests that T c and T * are very close and might even merge in the overdoped region.	0
EPL0580589-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This might be the reason that we do not observe a pseudogap in our tunneling studies.	0
EPL0580589-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The implication of the doping dependence of superconducting energy gap and T * is that they are intimately related.	0
EPL0580589-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The simplest notion is that T * represents the mean-field temperature for pairing, whereas T c defines when longrange phase coherence is established.	0

1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	For the type of spectra shown in (c), the extracted value of ∆ is 0.53 meV. To note, the experimental spectra slightly deviate from the theoretical fits just above the coherence peaks -this deviation was not seen in case of non intercalated PdTe 2 .	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	As we will discuss later, this type of spectra correspond to a higher T c ∼ 2.4 K. At certain other points, the spectra are seen to be different and their analysis reveal a smaller ∆ ∼ 0.44 meV. These spectra also correspond to a lower T c ∼ 1.7 K. The deviation of the experimental data from the theoretical fits are seen for these spectra as well.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	For the spectra with smaller ∆, though the T c remains to be same as that of pure PdTe 2 , the gap is measured to be higher than in pure PdTe 2 (∼ 0.32 meV).	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Hence, the the effect of intercalation is present everywhere including the points where a lower T c (and lower ∆) is measured.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	From a comparative consideration of the results discussed above, it appears that the superconducting phase with higher T c that is expected to emerge upon Cuintercalation (as per bulk measurements) appears at several places (as in ) while, at several other places, the enhancement of superconducting properties is less (as in ).	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	This suggests that the phase with higher T c, though does not arise uniformly throughout the crystals, exceeds the percolation threshold thereby contributing predominantly in bulk transport measurements.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	In order to search for a correlation between the domains with higher T c phase and the defect states due to Cu, we performed local spectroscopy near and away from such defects.	0

1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	One of the most intriguing features of the superconducting phase of PdTe 2 is that despite hosting topologically non-trivial bands crossing the Fermi surface, the superconducting order parameter is found to be conventional and is seen to follow BCS-like temperature dependence.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	The conventional nature of the temperature dependence is also found in case of the two energy gaps that are measured in Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 .	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	The temperature dependent spectra along with the theoretical fits are shown in (a) for the phase with higher ∆ and in (b) for the phase with lower ∆. Surprisingly, in both the cases, while the lowest temperature spectra showed no additional features other than the sharp coherence peaks, at slightly elevated temperatures a small zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) is also seen to appear.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	When the emergence of the ZBCP is considered along with the slight deviation of the experimental spectra from the theoretical fit, it is important to first investigate whether a tiny unconventional component in the order parameter can be present here.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Such a ZBCP may appear due to a small unconventional component in the gap function that has a different temperature dependence than the dominating conventional component.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	In order to understand this point clearly, let us consider a temperature dependent gap amplitude given by ∆(T ) = α∆ s (T ) + β∆ un (T ), where ∆ s is the conventional component and ∆ un is the unconventional component of the gap, and α and β are the respective coefficients.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Now, since the ZBCP does not appear at low temperatures, it is clear that at those temperatures, α∆ s β∆ un .	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Now, with increasing temperature, due to the possible difference in temperature dependence of ∆ s and ∆ un , at some point, the contribution of ∆ un may become comparable to ∆ s thereby making the unconventional contribution detectable in the form of the ZBCP.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Beyond this temperature, as shown in the data, all the spectroscopic features related to superconductivity get systematically reduced with a complete disappearance of the spectral features at T c .	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	It should be noted that while the possibility of an unconventional component cannot be ruled out, the ZBCP may also originate from other sources, like inelastic impurity scattering with non-trivial temperature dependence.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Since no ZBCP is seen in pure PdTe 2 , here, the enhanced scattering may be due to the impurity states of the Cu intercalates.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Since the strength of the ZBCP is significantly smaller than the overall spectra, we have fitted the temperature dependent spectra ignoring the ZBCP.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	The temperature dependent ∆ thus obtained, are plotted in (c) and (d) respectively for the larger ∆ and the smaller ∆. The red dots represent the measured values of ∆ and the solid lines show the expected temperature dependence within BCS theory, barring a slight deviation at higher temperatures.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	In both the cases, the temperature evolution of the spectra is consistent with BCS theory.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	From the measured valued of ∆ and T c , it is seen that ∆/k B T c are ∼ 2.56 and 3.15 corresponding to the larger ∆ and the smaller ∆ respectively.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	This means, the regions where the effect of intercalation is smaller, ∆/k B T c is higher.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	This shows that the elctron-phonon coupling strength decreases upon Cu-intercalation.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	This result apparently contradicts the theoretical finding of an enhanced electron-phonon coupling constant (λ ph ) in Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 .	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, our results suggest that the enhancement in T c in Cu-PdTe 2 is primarily due to the enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy and not due to altered electron-phonon coupling.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	However, these two processes may compete with each other giving rise to an effective enhancement of superconducting properties in Cu-PdTe 2 .	0

1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Such variation of the type of superconductivity based on magnetic properties could be attributed to inhomogeneity of local coherence length (ξ).	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	An inhomogeneous background possibly responsible for such inhomogeneity in ξ was found in the normal state conductance maps.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Within this understanding, introduction of disorder into the crystal is expected to reduce ξ everywhere.	0

1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Hence the enhancement is not due to a naturally enhanced surface critical field.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	In (c), we also show Dyne's fit of one set of the magnetic field dependent spectra and the variation of the superconducting energy gap with increasing magnetic field is shown in (d), where the smooth disappearance of the gap is clearly visible.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	This observation indicates that the superconductivity of Cu-PdTe 2 has become uniformly of type II throughout the crystal upon intercalation of Cu.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	This is different from the mixed type I and type II superconducting phase that was observed in pure PdTe 2 .	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	The observation of the uniformly type II behaviour of the superconducting phase upon Cu-intercalation supports the idea that the mixed type I and type II phase in pure PdTe 2 originated from a distribution of the local coherence length (ξ) and consequent distribution of κ.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Introduction of disorder in the lattice causes increased scattering and a consequent decrease in the electronic mean free path (l) leading to a decreased ξ following the relation 1/ξ = 1/ξ 0 + 1/l, where ξ 0 is the BCS coherence length in the absolute clean limit.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	When the local ξ in the type I regions decrease, the GLAG parameter (κ) also decreases and consequently these regions should show magnetic properties of that of type II superconductors.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	The criteria for the transition from a type I to a type II superconducting state in terms of the mean free path (l) has been discussed elsewhere where it was also shown that beyond a critical value of l, the superconducting phase is expected to become homogeneously type II.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Another aspect of the magnetic field dependence of ∆ that needs attention is a sudden change in ∆ at H ∼ 100 Oe, where ∆ decreases to almost 50 % of the zero field value.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	In a type II superconductor, such a sudden change may be associated with the emergence of a superconducting vortex in an area very close to the STM tip thereby causing the suppression of local ∆. As shown in the Γ vs. H plot in (d), as ∆ shows a sudden drop, Γ shows a simultaneous upward jump (by a factor of 6) at approximately the same magnetic field.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Γ represents pair breaking mechanisms leading to finite quasiparticle lifetime.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Hence, this observation is consistent with the field-induced pair breaking under the STM tip, possibly due to the emergence of a nearby vortex core.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	However, despite our repeated attempts, we did not find spectra with clear zero-bias conductance peak in presence of magnetic field.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	To note, such zero-bias peaks in presence of sufficiently large magnetic field were frequently observed in pure PdTe 2 .	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	It is possible that in case of Cu-PdTe 2, the nature of the vortex core spectrum changes and becomes featureless and hence remains undetectable in our experiments.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	Beyond the field at which the sudden change happens, both ∆ and Γ change gradually and beyond a certain field Γ becomes larger than ∆ thereby suppressing the key spectroscopic features.	0

1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	We found that Cu-intercalation enhances the critical temperature throughout the crystal surface.	0
1903.04321.superconductors.tei.xml	In addition to T c enhancement, due to increased disorder, the surface of Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 becomes uniformly type II with no signature of co-existing type I phase anywhere.	0

L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is indeed roughly found in MgB 2 , where T c drops by a factor of 2 and H c2 (T = 0K) by a factor of 4 between ambient pressure and 20 GPa .	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However in 2H-NbSe 2 , below 5 GPa , H c2 (T = 0K) decreases nearly by a factor of 1.7, but T c increases by 18%.	0

L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	within an effective two band model, one can obtain the most significant anisotropy found over the FS in λ.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, it is not possible to obtain independent values for the whole set of four strong coupling parameters λ ij needed in a two band model (inter-and intra-band coupling).	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, as in Refs. , we reduce λ ij to only two : λ 1 = λ 11 for the band 1 with strongest coupling and λ 2 = λ 22 = λ 12 = λ 21 to characterize the more weakly coupled band 2, and its interband coupling to band 1.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This approximation gives the overall pressure evolution of the anisotropy of λ and of v F , although their absolute values may somewhat change in a more detailed treatment.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For the ambient pressure H c2 (T ) we fix λ 1 = 1.6 and λ 2 = 0.16	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	to obtain a corresponding overall mass renormalization (m * 1 /m − 1) = λ 11 + λ 12 = 1.76 (strong coupling Nb 4d cylinders), and (m * 2 /m − 1) = λ 22 + λ 21 = 0.32 (weak coupling Se 4p derived pocket) that compares well with the values mentioned above and obtained from de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) and ARPES studies .	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From the fit to H c2 (T ), we deduce the values of the ambient pressure unrenormalized Fermi velocities, v F,1 = 0.055 10 6 m/s and v F,2 = 1 10 6 m/s.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Other parameters of the model are the Coulomb pseudopotential µ * = 0.1, fixed arbitrarily, and a mean phonon frequency of θ = 55K, which is imposed to be pressure independent and is adjusted to give the right T c at P = 0.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Note however that changes in θ do not have a significant influence on the form of H c2 (T ), which essentially depends on the anisotropy of λ 1,2 and of v F,1,2 , whose pressure evolution is shown in .	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We find that the initial increase of T c with pressure , is essentially controlled by that of λ 1 , whereas ∂λ 2 /∂P at P = 0 is close to zero .	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Above 5 GPa, λ 1 decreases, but	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	λ 2 increases up to about 11 GPa, where the maximum in T c (P ) is found.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, v F,1 increases under pressure up to 8.3 GPa, where a clear peak is observed.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The evolution of v F,2 is exactly opposite and becomes roughly pressure independent above 15 GPa, where the coupling strength becomes more isotropic, but the FS anisotropy remains.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Let us first discuss the evolution of the Fermi velocities, which points to a new characteristic pressure of 8.3 GPa.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Anomalies on v F might reflect changes in the Fermi surface topology.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Indeed, assuming bands with a roughly quadratical dispersion, the Fermi velocities are related to their radius in k-space.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The eventual closing of a gap results in an increase of the area of the relevant FS, as already observed in the compound YNi 2 B 2 C, where the behavior of H c2 (T ) under pressure evidences a strong increase of v F in the strong coupling bands, related to the disappearance of a FS nesting feature under pressure .	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, in the case of MgB 2 , the observed decrease in v F,1 under pressure is related to a continuous shrinking of the strong coupling sheets under pressure due to the reduction of their hole doping, achieved at zero pressure through its ionic layered character .	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In 2H-NbSe 2 , the behavior of v F,1 and v F,2 is more intriguing.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The pressure evolution of v F,1,2 is not changed by the disappearance of the CDW order.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Instead, it peaks at 8.3 GPa, closely following the strong decrease of v F,2 , which stops at the same pressure.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	While the Nb 4d derived cylinders increase its size under pressure, the Γ centered pancake FS shrinks.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Moreover, the whole smooth increase of λ 2 from 0.3 up to 0.8 at intermediate pressures reflects the progressive decrease of weight of the effect of the Se 4p pancake pocket on the weak coupling parameters of the effective two band model, in favor of the Nb 4d cylinder which shows, at ambient pressure, intermediate coupling.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The increase of v F,2 above 8.3 GPa then reflects, like λ 2 , the dominant effect in H c2 (T) of the Nb 4d bands at higher pressures.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	So the main feature pointed out by the minimum of v F,2 and the increase of λ 2 is a charge transfer from the Se 4p pocket, which shrinks under pressure, to the Nb 4d-derived cylinders, which correspondingly increase its size.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This leaves only the Nb 4d bands control H c2 (T ) at the highest pressures.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As regard now the evolution of the coupling parameters, the striking result from this two-band analysis is that contrary to the anomaly on the Fermi velocities (at 8.3 GPa), or the maximum of T c (at 10.5 GPa), λ 1 peaks at the pressure where the CDW order has been reported to vanish ).	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is remarkable that this maximum occurs only in the strong coupling part of the FS, i.e. the Nb 4d-derived cylinders.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The CDW gap has been reported to open on those cylinders, but not on the Se 4p-derived pocket .	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Clearly, the fact that in 2H-NbSe 2 , the suppression of the CDW order does not coincide with the maximum in T c makes an interesting contrast with respect to a number of other systems with competing or coexisting ground states, and where T c is maximum at a critical pressure, or doping, where another type of instability disappears.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For example, in many layered high T c superconductors, a close relationship is found between the doping dependence of T c and of T * , the pseudogap critical temperature (in hole doped as well as in electron doped materials, see e.g. ).	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the Ce heavy fermion systems under pressure , a maximum appears in T c at the same pressure where the Neel temperature is suppressed, demonstrating the implications of the softening of magnetic modes in the formation of superconducting correlations.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the case of 2H-NbSe 2 , it would be also tempting to interpret the peak in λ 1 in terms of some kind of mode softening near the suppression of the CDW order.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, we can equally argue that the increase in λ 1 when T CDW decreases is related to an increase of the density of states due to the pressure induced suppression of the CDW gap.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In that case, clearly, the CDW ground state would be in strong competition with superconductivity.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The electron-phonon coupling of the strongest coupling Nb 4d band would be responsible for both ground states, triggering the appearance of the CDW when approaching 5 GPa from high pressures.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Our results leave both scenarios open for future debate.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Nevertheless, it becomes clear that superconductivity does not have its maximum T c when CDW order is suppressed, but when the overall coupling constant has an optimal value.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This optimum results from the competition between a favorable charge transfer from the Se 4p band to the Nb 4d bands, and a decreasing electron phonon coupling with increasing pressure.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Summarizing, our results clearly point to a maximum of the electron-phonon coupling on the FS sheet with largest λ at the pressure where the CDW order is suppressed.	0
L095117006-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The strongly pressure dependent interplay between the electron phonon coupling and the multiband structure of the FS, which is essential for the superconducting state, versus the FS anomalies, which are determinant for the CDW order, has been clarified through the measurement of T c and H c2 (T ) under pressure.	0

L092157004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We found that this anomaly was insensitive to magnetic fields as large as 14 T. The origin of this anomaly is not clear, and it may be related to another order parameter in the vicinity of the superconducting phase on the phase diagram.	0
L092157004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From our specific heat data, we extract a normal state γ value of 16.6 mJ/K 2 Co-mole.	0

L092157004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, we can fit the observed DOS to that of the free electron tight binding band on a triangular lattice with hopping matrix element t ef f .	0
L092157004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	With t ef f < 0 and x = 0.35, the tight binding DOS for both spins is 0.16/|t ef f |.The measured DOS then implies that |t ef f | ≈ 23 meV, or a full bandwidth of 9|t ef f | ≈ 0.2 eV, which is a factor of 7 smaller than the LDA bandwith.	0
L092157004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We therefore conclude that there is a mass enhancement of ∼ 7 compared with band theory.	0
L092157004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	By assuming g = 2, we find that the measured χ c of 3.5 × 10 −4 cm 3 /Co-mole corresponds to a free electron DOS of 10.86 states/eV. This gives a Wilson ratio 4π 2 k 2 /3(gµ B ) 2 χ/γ of 1.53.	0

Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	This is in agreement with the previous report , although the two T c values are slightly higher in the present case, which is likely due to the different sample preparation conditions.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	We emphasize that since no additional peaks are observed in the XRD data, the SC at r T c is unlikely due to a secondary phase with different structure.	0

Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	Note that the small γ n value of SnSb is indicative of a weak electron correlation, which precludes the formation of a textured superconducting phase due to a competing order .	0

Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	One possibility is that the existence of two superconducting transitions is due to the micro-phase segregation with a spread in the Sn/Sb ratio, which has been observed in long-term annealed SnSb samples .	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	These off-stoichiometric regions usually have a characteristic length of a few hundred μm or smaller and a very similar structure to SnSb , and thus are difficult to distinguish by the XRD measurements.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	Although a much shorter annealing time is adopted in the present study, it is possible that these inhomogeneous regions are already present, which is responsible for the resistive transition at r T c , as in La 3 Rh 4 Sn 3 .	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	Moreover, the initial diamagnetic signal in the susceptibility data could also be due to these regions.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	Hence we take the shielding fraction of ∼13% at 1.66 K, the temperature at which the linear interpolation of the strong diamagnetic signal intersects with the baseline (see (a), as an estimation of the upper limit of their volume faction.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	This indicates that such inhomogeneous regions, if they exist, occupy only a small part of the sample, consistent with the absence of an anomaly in the specific heat data near r T c. Hence, their presence has no practical effect in determining the intrinsic properties of SnSb.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	Another possibility is that the zero resistivity transition results from the strain effect at the grain boundaries.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	It is prudent to note that SnSb is not a line compound , and hence rapid quench is necessary to retain the phase to room temperature.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	During this process, it is expected that the grain surface cools faster than the interior, which leads to the development of strain at the grain boundaries.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	This may result in the increase in density of states and/or phonon softening, and consequently an enhanced T c .	0

Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	This implies that, within the BCS framework, the lower T c value of SnSb in the rhombohedral structure compared with that in the rock-salt structure is due to a decrease in the electron-phonon coupling strength.	0

Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	As for SnSb, the SOC effect is expected to be even stronger, and hence the possibility of odd-parity pairing cannot be excluded.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	In this regard, to better understand the SC in SnSb, a combined theoretical and spectroscopic study of its band structure and Fermi surface is strongly called for.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	In summary, we have studied the electrical transport, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of SnSb, which confirms the occurrence of SC in this natural superlattice phase.	1
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	It is further shown that the material is a bulk type-II superconductor below 1.50 K with a BCS-like gap.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	Nevertheless, the zero resistivity transition takes place at a considerably higher temperature of 2.48 K, for which two possibilities are discussed.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	One possibility is that this is due to the presence of inhomogeneous regions with off-stoichiometric Sn/Sb compositions due to the micro-phase segregation.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	Another possible scenario is that the enhanced T c in the resistivity measurement results from the strain effect that develops at the grain boundaries during the sample quenching.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	We also compare the properties of SnSb with those of the rock-salt structure SnAs superconductor, which suggests that the lower T c in SnSb is likely due to a weakening of the electronphonon coupling strength.	0
Liu_2018_Supercond._Sci._Technol._31_125011.superconductors.tei.xml	Since SnSb can be regarded as a close relative to the topological semimetal Sb, further band structure calculations and surface-sensitive spectroscopic studies are called for to assess the potential of this material as a topological superconductor.	0

L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, for y ≃ 6.7 there is a marked anomaly that ξ ab deviates upwardly from the general trend, which corresponds to a suppression of H MF c2 in the 60-K phase [].	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is in accord with the trend already apparent in .	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We note that this implication on the upper critical field is actually corroborated by the behavior of the resistive transition in 16 T, where the 60-K-phase samples show a marked broadening compared to other compositions, as demonstrated in .	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, both ξ ab and the resistive transition appear to indicate that the superconductivity is anomalously weak to the applied magnetic field in the region near y=6.7.	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is worthwhile to note that the present data are useful for elucidating the origin of the 60-K plateau.	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Remember that the 60-K plateau is just a plateau and is not a dip in T c, and there has been no clear evidence that the superconductivity is weakened in the plateau; it should therefore be recognized that our result for H c2 gives evidence that the superconductivity is actually weakened	0

L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since the weakening of the superconductivity is the fundamental feature of the 1/8 anomaly in the La-based cuprates, the present result clearly speaks for the 1/8-anomaly origin of the 60-K plateau.	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Furthermore, comparisons of the Hall coefficient R H and aaxis thermopower S a of 60-K YBCO to those of LSCO at x=0.12 strongly suggest that the hole doping is in fact 1/8 for y ≃ 6.65; Figs. 6(b) and 6(c) show such comparisons in R H (T )e/V 0 (V 0 is the volume per Cu in the plane) and S a (T ), which demonstrate that LSCO at x=0.12 and YBCO at y ≃ 6.65 show quite similar values near room temperature, and these parameters have been proposed to be good indicators of the hole doping in cuprates .	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, it appears that in the 60-K plateau the hole doping is actually ∼1/8 and the superconductivity is weakened, which together mean that the 60-K plateau is a manifestation of the 1/8 anomaly.	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is useful to note that a reasonably good case for the connection between the plateau and the 1/8 anomaly was made previously in a complementary way, using Ca doping .	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	"It should however be noted that static charge stripes (a sort of charge density wave that localizes the carriers) do not appear to be the fundamental ""cause"" of the weakening of the superconductivity in YBCO, since there is no evidence for static stripes in YBCO."	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is of course possible that the impact of the stripes at the 1/8 doping varies depending on the level of dynamics of the stripes in various cuprate systems.	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A more interesting possibility is that a proximity to a quantum critical point (QCP) is the more fundamental cause of the 1/8 anomaly: Recently, Aeppli et al. reported that the magnetic response of the Nd-free LSCO (where there is also no evidence for static charge stripes) bears a signature of the quantum criticality.	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In our data, fluctuations seem to be enhanced near y=6.7 while the superconductivity is suppressed, which might also be an indication of a proximity to a QCP; if so, this particular QCP suppresses superconductivity through enhanced fluctuations, rather than creates superconductivity.	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Lastly, we note the implication of the overall evolution of ξ ab .	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In cuprates, the pseudogap causes the energy gap ∆ to grow upon underdoping , and thus there is no proportionality between ∆ and T c .	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is therefore not obvious whether ξ ab should follow the behavior of ∆ or that of T c .	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is a rather fundamental problem in the pseudogap physics , but experimental data have been lacking.	0
L088167005-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The complicated y dependence of ξ ab indicates that neither ∆ nor T c are solely decisive and that an elaborate theory is necessary to describe ξ ab .	0

EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In high quality films λ(T ) exhibits the same linear temperature dependence as single crystals, showing its intrinsic nature, and λ(0) = 1750Å.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In a lower quality one, the more usual T 2 dependence is found, and λ(0) = 3600Å.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This suggests that the T 2 variation is of extrinsic origin.	0

EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	While in the BCS weak coupling theory, the penetration depth λ(T ) varies as exp(−∆/k B T ), a quadratic behavior λ(T ) ∼ T 2 was reported by many groups in YBCO thin films .	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Recently, in very high quality YBCO single crystals, a linear temperature dependence was measured up to 40 K .	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Such a variation, never observed so far in YBCO thin films , is consistent with the occurrence of nodes in the gap and may suggest a d-wave pairing mechanism .	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However other possible interpretations have been raised, both theoretically and experimentally, e.g. a possible proximity effect with a normal metal layer , or the sensitivity of a conventional BCS type λ(T ) to the oxygenation of the samples .	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Several reasons for the discrepancy observed between thin films and single crystals may be invoked: (i) within the framework of d-wave pairing, scattering due to impurities or defects may change the linear temperature dependence into a quadratic one in thin films , where such defects would be more numerous.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However T c should then also be affected, which is not the case .	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(ii) weak links, more likely to be present in thin films, may yield an effective penetration depth (larger than the intrinsic one) with a different temperature dependence .	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The penetration depth λ has been essentially measured in both single crystals and thin films by using surface impedance techniques at a single frequency .	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Such measurements actually measure the variation ∆λ(T ) = λ(T ) − λ(0), but without the knowledge of λ(0) on each sample, comparing the temperature dependence of various samples may not be significant.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This paper reports for the first time, from high frequency transmission data, both an unambiguous linear temperature dependence of λ(T ) on high quality YBCO thin films, which is quantitatively the same as in single crystals , and simultaneously λ(0) ∼ 1750Å.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We observe a quadratic temperature dependence on a lower quality sample, and λ(0) ∼ 3600Å.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We suggest that this T 2 dependence in thin films is not a consequence of strong scattering (in contrast with Zn or Ni doped materials ) but is of extrinsic origin.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The intrinsic dependence of λ(T ) at low temperature is linear.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This linear dependence points plainly toward the existence of low energy excitations, but our 3 results alone do not allow to identify them.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A natural and popular explanation is that they are due to nodes in the gap arising from unconventional pairing of d-wave type , an interpretation also conveyed by SQUID experiments .	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Our results provide support to d-wave pairing, because they show a linear behavior in films, but also because they eliminate the uncomfortable need to explain the T 2 dependence by impurity scattering at the unitary limit .	0

EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For a film of thickness d (smaller than the skin depth in the normal state or the penetration depth in the superconducting state) deposited onto a substrate of index n, the transmission writes : where σ = σ 1 − iσ 2 is the complex conductivity of the film, Z 0 the impedance of free space and Z = 1/σd the impedance of the film.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	If in the energy and temperature range of interest σ 2 (T ) ≫ σ 1 (T ) and σ 2 dZ 0 1+n ≫ 1, we can write: where σ 110 is the normal 110 K conductivity of the film.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We choose to normalize the transmission at 110 K because the ratio thus obtained is experimentally more reliable than the absolute value of the transmission.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For simplicity we assumed σ 110 dZ 0 1+n ≫ 1 in (2).	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, the measurement of T/T 110 yields an absolute value of λ(T ).	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The uncertainties on the λ(T ) 4 value which arise when neglecting the interferences within the film and/or the substrate, and the effect of the finite film thickness with respect to λ(T ) have been estimated: the transmission is fairly insensitive to the interference effects at our frequencies as can be shown by comparing a complete expression for T to .	0

EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This confirms that the frequency dependent part of the transmission varies as ω 2 , and that σ 2 (ω, T ) ≫ σ 1 (ω, T ) in these temperature ranges.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	λ(0) is found to be 1750 ± 160Å for B2 and 3600 ± 200Å for A1.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The uncertainty on λ(0) depends mostly on the accuracy on the σ 110 measurement, which is limited by the uncertainty on the film thickness (±100Å) and by the Van der Pauw technique.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Finally the most striking result is the temperature dependence of λ(T ).	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For sample A1, we find as shown in the inset, a clear T 2 dependence, a fairly common result for thin films , associated with a very large value for λ(0).	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In contrast, for sample B2, we find a linear temperature dependence up to 50 K along with a much shorter λ(0).	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Such a linear behavior was similarly observed in film B1.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We now discuss the implications of these results.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We believe that they demonstrate clearly the extrinsic origin of the T 2 dependence found previously in thin films.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Indeed they agree with a phenomenological expression λ 2 (T ) = λ 2 intr (T )+λ 2 extr (T ) as proposed by Hylton	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	et al., with λ extr being for example the contribution of weak links (but our conclusions are obviously independent of this specific expression).	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	When λ extr is the dominating contribution as in our film A1 it may produce the T 2 dependence which is likely to change from sample to sample.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Indeed, the data of Porch et al. (see inset of Fig. 3) are not the same as ours.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, for good enough films, λ extr gets negligible and we find the intrinsic behavior for λ(T ) which is linear, and is expected to be unchanged from films to crystals.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The YBCO single crystals results of Hardy et al. are reported on Fig. 4, shifted to our λ(0) value.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The excellent agreement between the two sets of data confirms the intrinsic nature of λ in film B2.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We remark that the agreement between λ(T ) in two completely unrelated samples is a very strong result since, except for a coincidence, it eliminates any extrinsic explanation like poor surface effects or pair breaking due to magnetic impurities , for the interpretations of the linear dependence.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However the nature of the low energy excitations is still unknown and it is also not yet clear whether they are linked to the planes or to the chains.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Furthermore, the T 2 dependence appears in a film where the penetration depth 6 is large.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Our λ intr (0) is much shorter.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is larger though than λ ab (0) = 1450-1490Å derive by µSR , and consistent with λ a (0) = 1600Å provided by infrared reflectance data .	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We believe that most techniques do not provide as a straightforward determination as ours.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Our results offer a solution to a previous uncomfortable situation arising in the d-wave	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	interpretation of the experimental results for λ(T ).	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Indeed in order to explain the T 2 behavior in films together with the linear dependence in single crystals, theoretical calculations had to call for a high impurity concentration in films.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	But this implies a significant difference between T c for films and crystals which is not observed.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The proposed escape was to assume that the impurity concentration was rather low with a scattering very near the unitary limit, a very specific hypothesis.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this case T c could be little changed by impurities while the low T behavior of λ(T ) would be much more affected.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since our results show that the T 2 behavior is extrinsic, e.g. due to weak links , all the results become coherent with a reasonably low content of ordinary scatterers.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In order to interpret quantitatively our results, it is convenient to make use of the sim-plified two-dimensional model of d-wave like pairing introduced by Xu et al. [12], where the gap has a linear dependence near the nodes and is constant elsewhere: |∆(θ)| = µ∆ 0 θ for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1/µ and |∆(θ)| = ∆ 0 for 1/µ ≤ θ ≤ π/4, θ being the angle with respect to the node position on the Fermi surface and the rest of ∆(θ) being obtained by symmetry.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The density of states is taken as constant.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This model contains the essential physical ingredients to represent a general order parameter with d-wave symmetry, except for the possible effect of Van Hove singularities.	0
EPL0330153-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The slope of λ(T ) at T = 0 is given by 2 ln 2/µ∆ 0 , however when ∆ 0 is calculated with a weak coupling assumption, the result can only be made to agree with experiment up to 20 K and it does not reproduce the remarkable linear behavior up to 55 K.

L092227003-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Note that the resistivity changes are rather large, ∆ρ ab /ρ ab reaches ≈ 18% at T = 5 K and exceeds 32% at 2.5 K, indicating that the magnetic field B [100] can effectively localize the doped electrons.	0
L092227003-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	"Apparently, the fascinating MR oscillations in cannot originate from simple ""spin-valve"" effects, since at high fields the spin structure always stays collinear, and all that changes is the relative orientation of spins with respect to the crystal axes."	0

MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It was reported that the material is exceptionally sensitive to both temperature and humidity near ambient conditions, which makes the experimental reproducibility rather difficult.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Consequently, only a few experimental results, such as the magnetic properties and the hydrostatic pressure effect on T c have just been reported.	0

MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this Letter, we report some superconducting and normal-state properties of this intriguing compound.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Our samples of Na 0.31 CoO 2 ·1.3H 2 O were prepared in four steps, briefly described as follows.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	First, singlephase hexagonal Na 0.74 CoO 2 was prepared by a solidstate reaction at 1083 K in flowing oxygen with Na 2 CO 3 and Co 3 O 4 as the starting material.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Second, partial sodium in Na 0.74 CoO 2 was deintercalated by the excessive bromine solved in acetonitrile, similar to the treatment reported previously .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Third, a hydration process was carried out by the direct reaction with distilled water.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	"Last, the sample was slightly dehydrated and then ""annealed"" under ambient condition."	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Powder Xray Diffraction (XRD) measurement indicates that the final product is a hexagonal single phase with the cell constants of a=2.820Å and c=19.65Å .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The unit cell is slightly stretched along the c-axis, compared with that of the previous report .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is probably due to the difference in the Na content.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	By employing the Atomic absorption spectroscopy, the atomic ratio of Na and Co was determined as 0.31 for the final product.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the weight loss from 293 K to 693 K is 19.8 %, indicating that the content of H 2 O is about 1.3 per formula.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the chemical formula of the final product is expressed as Na 0.31 CoO 2 ·1.3H 2 O. Details of the sample's preparation and characterizations will be given elsewhere .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The physical property measurements were performed at the temperature down to 1.8 K and under the field up to 8 Tesla, on a Quantum Design PPMS system.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	"While measured under ""zero field"", there still exists a remanent field of ∼ 1 Oe."	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The precisions of ac magnetic susceptibility (χ ac ) and dc susceptibility (χ dc ) are better than ∼ 10 −7 emu and ∼ 10 −5 emu, respectively.	0

MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The diamagnetic screening signal at 1.9 K is 9.2 % of the full shielding when the ac field amplitude (H ac ) is 2 Oe, suggesting relatively low superconducting fraction.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Considering that the χ ′ value is not flat down to 1.9 K, the superconducting volume fraction will be over 10 % under the remanent field of ∼ 1 Oe.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The imaginary component of the ac susceptibility shows an incomplete dissipation peak, also suggesting that the superconducting transition is not finished yet at 1.9 K. The dc susceptibility under 30 Oe shows even low magnetic exclusion, which is primarily due to the very low H c1 value as well as the magnetic penetration (see the result below).	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	An irreversible temperature can be noticed, like that observed in the high T c cuprates.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From the structural and chemical bonding points of view, the present system should have very weak coupling between the CoO 2 layers, resulting in a strong 2D superconductivity.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is proposed that the relatively low superconducting fraction is mainly due to the sample's intrinsic 2D characteristic.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The following observations are coincident with this point.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	First, the superconducting transition is broad.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Second, zero resistance can never be achieved in our experiments as well as the previous report .	0

MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Similar result was reported for a 2D organic superconductor (BEDT-TTF) 2 Cu(NCS) 2 .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It should be pointed out that the low superconducting fraction is not mainly due to the sample's instability, because our XRD experiment shows that the sample contains no secondary phases before and after the magnetic susceptibility measurements.	0

MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The H c2 value is difficult to be measured by the M − H curve due to the very narrow hysteresis.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Nevertheless, by measuring the electrical resistance at fixed temperatures, one can basically obtain the H c2 (T ) data, as shown in figure 2(b).	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	H c2 (T ) is here determined as the point where the resistance deviates from the linearity in the R − H 2 curves .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The slope of H c2 at T c , dH c2 /dT | Tc , is obtained as −34 kOe/K. H c2 (0) can thus be estimated to be 1×10 5 Oe, using the WHH formula .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Then, the average Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherent length ξ GL (0)=57Å can be calculated using the formula ξ GL (0)=(Φ 0 /2πH c2 (0) 1/2 .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, by solving the equation H c1 = Φ 0 ln(λ/ξ)/4πλ 2 , the average penetration depths can also be obtained: λ(0)=7900Å .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ = λ/ξ GL is estimated as ∼ 140, indicating that the cobalt oxyhydrate is an extreme type-II superconductor, like the high-T c cuprates.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This conclusion has also been drawn in a very recent report , in which different method was employed to determine the H c2 (T ).	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is worth while to note that, compared with the previous result, the values of H c1 (0) and H c2 (0) in the present sample are remarkably smaller, which is possibly resulted from the differences in the carrier-doping level and/or the water content.	0

MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The phonon contribution can be separated by employing the T 2 vs C/T plot.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It can be seen that good linearity is satisfied in the temperature range of 4.5 K< T <11 K. We thus obtained γ = 15.9 mJ/K 2 ·mol-f.u.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(f.u.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	denotes formula unit) and β = 0.235 mJ/K 4 · mol-f.u.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Θ D is then calculated to be 391 K using the formula Θ D = (12/5)N π 4 R/β) 1/3 , where N =7.21 for Na 0.31 CoO 2 ·1.3H 2 O and R=8.314 J/mol·K. The γ value is significantly smaller than that of the parent compound Na 0.5 CoO 2 (γ ∼ 40 mJ/K 2 ·mol-Co ).	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since the Sommerfeld parameter γ is related to the density of state (DOS) at Fermi level, N (E F ), by the relation where N (0) is the bare, or band-structure electronic DOS at E F , λ ep an electron-phonon interaction parameter , one can obtain that N (E F )=6.7 states/eV·f.u.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, λ ep can be calculated to be 0.57 using the formula where Coulomb repulsion parameter µ * is assumed to be 0.13 empirically .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, N (0) is derived to be 4.3 states/eV·f.u.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We note that this value is almost identical to the band calculation result (4.4 states/eV·Co) for the parent compound Na 0.5 CoO 2 .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is noted that the sample's magnetic susceptibility (∼ 2.0×10 −3 emu/mol-f.u) is almost temperature independent from 30 K to 300 K (not shown here).	0

MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The parameter C gives the small effective magnetic moment of 0.14 µ B .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The small positive θ value suggests the existence of weak ferromagnetic correlations.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The unusually large χ 0 value should be dominantly contributed by χ P auli , which is probably enhanced by the Stoner-type ferromagnetic correlation.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The Wilson ratio, R W = π 2 k 2 B χ P auli /3γµ 2 B , is calculated to be 11, in sharp contrast with the case of heavy fermion superconductor .	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At 4.3 K, specific heat anomalies can be seen, which is ascribed to the superconducting transition.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The specific heat jump at the T c under zero field, ∆C obs , is 6.9 mJ/K·mol-f.u, further confirming the bulk superconductivity.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	When applying magnetic field, both the ∆C obs and T c decrease as expected.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is noted that the T c (H) values are basically consistent with the H c2 (T ) result described above.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The specific jump at T c , ∆C, can be calculated using an approximate formula ∆C = H c (0) 2 /2πT c , where H c (0) is the thermodynamic critical field.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	H c (0) is found to be 505 Oe by using the formula H c (0) = H c2 (0)/ √ 2κ, where H c2 (0) and κ are 1×10 5 Oe and 140, respectively.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Then, ∆C should be 38.2 mJ/K·mol-f.u.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the superconducting fraction is estimated to be ∆C obs /∆C=18.1 %, which is basically consistent with the magnetic susceptibility measurement result.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In addition, the average superconducting gap at zero temperature, ∆ a (0), can be obtained using the relation , ∆ a (0) is then obtained to be 0.50 meV. The value of 2∆ a (0)/k B T c is found to be 2.71, suggesting that the system belongs to the weak coupling limit.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A further data-analysis was carried out as follows.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The lattice specific-heat contribution, C L = βT 3 , was first deducted, obtaining the electronic specific heat term: C el = C − C L .	0

MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Though the extra-low temperature data is absent here due to the experimental limitation, fitting on the present data may give a preliminary clue.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In , it can be seen that the T 3 dependence best fits the C es (T ) data, suggesting point nodes for the superconducting gap.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It should be mentioned that the T 3 dependence most favors the data in the wide range of 13 % ≤ η ≤ 20 % (When η ≤ 12 %, C es becomes a negative value at 1.8 K).	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Based on symmetry and some preliminary experimental results, Tanaka and Hu proposed spin triplet superconductivity in the cobalt oxyhydrate.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The p-wave superconductivity was also suggested by Baskaran for the higher doping level.	0
MAT0305503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Owing to the ferromagnetic correlation in the normal state, as stated above, spin-triplet p-wave pairing is very probable.	0

P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Comparison of the low-temperature specific heat of the high-pressure oxydized (HPO) (Cu,Mo)1212 sample of the previous figure (black dots) with previously reported data on overdoped La2−xSrxCuO4 with x=0.259 (Tc=6.5 K, blue squares) and x=0.290 (non superconducting, red diamonds) and on optimally doped La2−xSrxCuO4 with x=0.178 (green open circles) and YBa2Cu3O 7−δ with δ=0.05 (black open squares).	1

P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As to the origin of such a large γ, we rule out extrinsic effects like contribution of metallic impurities, as their amount is below the detection limit ∼1 % of powder neutron diffraction.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Further evidence of an electronically homogeneous phase is given by the µSR data.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The data were obtained on a (Cu,Mo)1212 powder sample prepared and oxydized under the same conditions as the previously discussed sample and with the same T c =84 K. µSR is a phase volume sensitive technique and muons uniformly and locally probe the sample.	1
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	So, if the sample contained different spatially separated phases, the muon signal would be the sum of different components, each component with its own precession frequency and broadening.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In our sample we do not observe this behavior; the data can be fitted by a single precession signal with an amplitude corresponding to a 80% superconducting fraction in the vortex state, a Gaussian relaxation rate σ and a background contribution.	0

P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At low temperatures, the linear decrease of σ with temperature is also typical of a d-wave pairing symmetry.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Overall the µSR data show that the sample is superconducting and homogeneous at least on length scales of ∼ 1µm corresponding to a few magnetic penetration depths.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, we cannot exclude inhomogeneities on much shorter length scales.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Having excluded the possibility of secondary phases or of other inhomogeneities on the microscopic length scale, the existence of a high temperature superconducting phase where simple metal physics is expected is our most important finding.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In characterizing the superconducting state, several other striking features become apparent: 1) As in other clean cuprates, at low temperatures compared to T c, the superfluid density decreases linearly with temperature.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Generally, this is associated with the existence of nodal quasiparticles, as in the case of a clean, d-wave superconductor, which gives indirect evidence that even in this highly overdoped regime, the system is a d-wave superconductor.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	2) Reconciliation of the µSR and heat capacity data puts tight constraints on an acceptable model.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At the lowest temperatures we can probe, there remains a T -linear term in the specific heat with a finite intercept showing the presence of non-condensed holes in the superconducting state.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In order to avoid proximity-induced condensation, this requires that these holes should be confined in regions larger than the coherence length, ξ ∼ 10 nm, but smaller than the penetration length, as discussed above.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A scenario of a partial hole condensation in hole overdoped cuprates is supported by earlier specific heat data on overdoped La214 single crystals and, more recently, by kinetic inductance measurements on well characterized La214 single-crystal films, with p = 0.295, i.e. at the edge of the dome .	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The question arises whether the failure of complete condensation of the carriers in hole overdoped cuprates may be a more general phenomenon than has been realized.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In order to verify this possibility, more studies on the (Cu,Mo)1212 phase are required.	0
P066132510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For example, it would be highly desirable to vary oxygen doping and to obtain single crystals, which are needed for transport and spectrocopic investigations.	0

P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	There have been a number of reports of the coexistence of magnetic order and exotic superconductivity: for example, in Ce and U-based heavy fermion systems , in superoxygenated La 2 CuO 4+δ , in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 and more recently in the well underdoped regime of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+x (x=0.5-0.6) .	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	"In the last case , the observation that the magnetic intensity decreases at large momentum more rapidly than does the Cu-spin form factor, has been considered to support the suggestion of orbital moments of a d-wave density-wave (DDW) order parameter (that could be the hidden order responsible for the ""pseudo-gap phase"" of underdoped cuprates) ."	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, in the cuprates, the real coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity or a microscopic phase segregation remains a matter of discussion.	0

P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	NMR and transport measurements show the cobalt substitution reduces the hole doping.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, for the low Co substitution level (y ≃ 0.013) examined here, despite the decrease in the Hall effect derived carrier density and in the specific heat derived condensate density , the doping is still high enough for T c to remain at its optimum value.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In addition, Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) measurements have evidenced the appearance of magnetic moments on the Cu of the Cu(1) sites and more surprisingly on those of the Cu(2) sites as well.	0

P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The observed pattern (.c) and the absence of any magnetic peak at Q=(0.5,0.5,0) implies that the magnetic response is fully dominated by magnetic moments at the Cu(2) sites.	0

P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The peak intensity displays a marked downturn at T m ≃ 12 K, and almost half of its intensity is left as T→ 0.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Below T m , additional neutron intensity occurs at L=1.5 indicating the system undergoes an AFI-AFII transition, characterized by the doubling of the AF unit cell along the c axis.	0

P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The re-ordering observed in the present case may be linked to the influence of magnetic freezing which is known to exist in in similar samples, For example, in YBa 2 (Cu 0.94 Co 0.06 ) 3 O 7+δ, time of flight neutron scattering measurements have evidenced the progressive freezing of the Co moments as the temperature is lowered in agreement with local probe measurements .	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Without producing any reduction in the superconducting transition temperature, the substitution of magnetic Co 3+ at the chain sites thus introduces a very specific perturbation which induces a commensurate AF 3D order, below T N ∼ 330 K, at the copper sites of the CuO 2 planes.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A key question is how does the superconductivity and the antiferromagnetic order cohabit ?	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	To address this issue, we first consider the possibility of complete phase segregation, such that only a small fraction of Cu(2) atoms, for example those adjacent to a Co atom, carries the full magnetic moment of the undoped cuprates (0.6 µ B ).	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The concentration of Cu(2) atoms (in the planes) needed to account for the observed scattering intensity would then be ∼ 3 % which is roughly comparable to the Co substitution level (in the chains).	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	There are a number of arguments against this hypothesis.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As the magnetic correlation length exceeds 200Å, then the Co would be essentially concentrated within these clusters.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Such Co clusters would yield an observable magnetic diffraction pattern.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The local Co concentration would also be quite high and we would expect to observe the behavior seen in samples having high Co levels.	0

P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We recall also that local probe Cu NQR and Mössbauer measurements on samples having the same low Co substitution level as the sample studied here have shown that over 50 % of the Cu(2) carry magnetic moments.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, it does not seem possible that the AF order could be linked to the existence of locally undoped regions.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Consequently, the two phenomena (AF and SC) appear to be in contact at a microscopic level.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As the Co atoms aggregate into dimers or small clusters forming lines along the (110) direction , we speculate that these lines of magnetic Co atoms are the perturbing elements which induce the AF order into the CuO 2 planes.	0

P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, the Ni and Zn substitutions have more drastic effects on the dynamical AF correlations: Zn already induces strong AF fluctuations in the normal state although it reduces the enhancement of the spin susceptibility in the SC state, whereas Ni renormalizes the resonance energy.	0
P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Following the observed 50% reduction in the weight of the resonance peak, it is possible that distinct superconducting regions occupy about half of the sample volume leaving the remainder for the distinct magnetically ordered regions.	0

P066020501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In their model, based on Ginsburg-Landau theory, a key assumption is that the SC state is in competition with the AF phase with a first order phase boundary, which enables the AF state to nucleate where SC is suppressed.	0

P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since the discovery of the high-temperature superconductors, one of the most important but unanswered questions has been how the electronic structure evolves from the antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI) to the superconductor (SC) as a function of doped hole concentration.	0
P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the case of La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO), recent angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) studies have shown that in underdoped samples, the chemical potential µ is pinned at ∼0.4 eV above the top of the lower Hubbard band (more precisely, top of the Zhang-Rice singlet band) and spectral weight is transferred from the lower Hubbard band to near µ with hole doping.	0
P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Also, it has been found from the photoemission measurements of core levels that the chemical potential does not move with hole doping in the underdoped region .	0
P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	These observations indicate a breakdown of the rigid-band picture and are suggestive of a dramatic reorganization of the electronic structure upon hole doping.	0
P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In fact, the suppression of the chemical potential shift has been attributed to the strong stripe fluctuations in LSCO because the charge stripes can be viewed as a kind of microscopic phase separation which will pin the chemical potential.	0

P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Then, considering the peculiar shift of the Bi 4f level, one may speculate that the broadening is caused by different shifts of the O 1s core levels from the diferent oxygen sites in the small δ region.	0

P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The shifts of the three components thus deduced are plotted in .	0
P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	One notices that as δ increases, the CuO 2 and SrO components (A and B) move upwards like the Sr 3d peak, while the Bi-O component (C) moves to downwards like the Bi 4f peak, leading to the broadening of the O 1s peak.	0
P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As for the Cu 2p core-level spectra (not shown), the peak becomes broader as δ increases in the Er samples.	0
P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the Pr samples, the Pr 3d core level overlaps with the Cu 2p core levels and therefore, it was difficult to identify the doping dependence of the line shape.	0

P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In order to deduce the chemical poential shift from the set of the core-level shift data, we note that the shift ∆E of a core-level energy measured relative to µ is given by ∆E = −∆µ + K∆Q + ∆V M + ∆E R , where ∆µ is the change in the chemical potential, K∆Q is the chemical shift, ∆V M is a shift due to a change in the Madelung potential, and ∆E R is the change in the core-hole screening .	0

P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As mentioned above, in the region δ > 0.1, the Bi 4f, Sr 3d and O 1s core levels show similar behaviors and therefore we can safely conclude that the shifts are primarily caused by the chemical potential shift.	0
P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the region δ < 0.1, the doping dependences of the core levels are complicated, most likely due to charge transfer from the CuO 2 layers (CuO 2 -Ca 1−x R x -CuO 2 blocks) to the Bi-O layers with decreasing δ and the resulting decrease of the Bi valence.	0
P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Considering the crystal chemistry of BSCCO, the SrO layer is supposed to have fixed charges and the Sr 3d level would be least influenced by the charge transfer, and we assume that the shift of the Sr 3d level most faithfully reflects the chemical potential shift in the entire hole concentration region.	0
P067172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Indeed, the shift of the O 1s peak from the SrO layer as well as that from the CuO 2 layer deduced from the line-shape analysis show nearly the same behavior and is most probably caused by the chemical potential shift.	0

P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This result indicates that, also in the orthorhombic phase, R H has a negative value at low temperatures in the hole concentration of x ∼ 0.12.	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	One thing which we would like to mention is that the origin of the negative R H is by no means the contribution of vortex dynamics.	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The reason is as follows: (a) In high-T c cuprates, the sign reversal of R H in the vortex states tends to vanish as increasing magnetic fields .	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The data in this study is contrary to this tendency.	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(b) As decreasing temperature, R H begins to decrease at the vicinity of T LT in LYSCO or at ∼50 K in LSCO rather than T c , and changes its sign continuously in each magnetic field.	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(c) In LYSCO, the sign reversal of R H occurs above T c in zero-field.	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(d) In policrystalline samples of LYSCO, this anomaly is significant around x = 0.115 28 .	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, we conclude that the sign reversal observed in this study is the intrinsic phenomena in the stripe phase.	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the last, we discuss the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power, which shows a similar temperature dependence .	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From the fact that the anomalous change of the Hall coefficient and of the thermoelectric power is the most significant around the hole concentration of x = 0.12, the origin of this anomalous change will be the same electronic state appeared below T LT .	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the thermoelectric power will shows the enhancement of this anomaly in high magnetic fields.	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In summary, the Hall coefficient of La 1.84 Y 0.04 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 and La 1.88 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 is measured in high magnetic fields up to 9 T. In the low-temperature tetragonal phase, as decreasing temperature, the Hall coefficient decreases and changes its sign at low temperatures.	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the orthorhombic La 1.88 Sr 0.12 CuO 4, the sign reversal of the Hall coefficient appears under high magnetic fields above 8 T. The anomalous behavior of the Hall coefficient, that is the sign reversal, is enhanced in the condition that the superconductivity is suppressed by magnetic fields applied to the direction perpendicular to the CuO 2 plane.	0
P066104528-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the Hall coefficient has a finite negative value in the ground state of the stripe phase.	0

P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Some fraction of the Mg has probably transported to the bottom of the crucible before the temperature has increased to a point where reaction kinetics become rapid.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Once the final temperature is reached, the reaction mixture is depleted in Mg since it is reacting faster than it can diffuse from the bottom of the crucible.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At longer times Mg is again observed in the reaction mixture since the equilibrium vapor pressure of Mg is reached in the product.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The reason the MgB 4 phase fraction never goes to zero could possibly be due to either 1), the slight loss of Mg due to volatility or its reaction with residual oxygen in the furnace or 2), the decomposition of MgB 2 due to the thermal gradients in the sample.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The decomposition pressures for MgB 2 have been calculated by Liu et al.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Using their result, a thermal gradient of about 400 o C would be required to have MgB 4 at the hotter sample top and Mg at the cooler crucible bottom.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This thermal gradient is not possible, thus the increasing MgB 4 content is most likely due to the lower Mg vapor pressure at the top surface of the sample due to reaction with residual oxygen in the furnace or Mg volatility.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This conclusion is supported by the observation of black MgB 4 present on the top surface of the reaction product after the 8hr reaction time.	0

P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	There is also a slow decomposition step leading to MgB 4 that is determined by the rate of Mg loss from the top surface of the reaction mixture.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This leads to a slightly nonuniform sample with Mg at the bottom of the crucible and MgB 4 at the top surface of the sample.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The T c 's (measured at the 5% level of the diamagnetic ac susceptibility) of the 0,1,2 and 4 hr samples were 39.21, 39.15, 39.23 and 39.08(5)K, respectively.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The T c was only significantly reduced for the sample with the longest reaction time showing the most MgB 4 .	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This consistency of the T c indicates the same stoichiometry and purity level of the MgB 2 in the reaction product.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Although these results show that the synthesis method is not perfect, they confirm that problems with Mg loss through volatility and secondary reactions with furnace impurities are sufficiently well controlled to allow the synthesis of high quality samples over a range of reaction times; i.e., the synthesis method can be viewed as leading to a final product in equilibrium conditions.	0

P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A reaction time of two hours was used for the composition dependant studies.	0

P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As expected, the dominate impurity in the Mg rich samples is Mg and in the Mg deficient samples is MgB 4 .	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, for the reasons discussed above, there is no point around x=1 at which a single phase is found.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The extrapolation of the Mg and MgB 4 concentrations to zero should show the single phase composition or single phase region of the phase diagram.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The least squares fits of the impurity contents extrapolated to zero concentration give Mg 1.00 B 2 and Mg 1.01 B 2 for Mg deficient and Mg excess starting compositions, respectively.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Based on only these data, the single phase composition could be on the slightly Mg rich side of the phase diagram or, conversely, a small region of variable nonstoichiometry could exist with up to 1% excess of Mg (or a deficiency of B).	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, the errors in this analysis are on the order of a few %, thus, MgB 2 appears to be a stoichiometric compound from this chemical analysis of the reaction products.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Rietveld analysis of the site occupancy in these samples indicates about a 1% deficiency in Mg (or excess B) as shown in .	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The site occupancy is constant, within our experimental accuracy, over the entire phase range investigated.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The refined value for the Mg site occupancy is not conclusive evidence that Mg vacancies actually exist.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the Rietveld refinement, Mg site deficiency could be mimicked by chemical substitution on either the Mg or B site (by elements with appropriately different scattering lengths) or by a failure of the Rietveld refinement code to correctly model the anharmonic thermal motion of the B atoms.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The latter problem would be expected to yield artificially increased values for both the site occupancy and harmonic temperature factor of B, consistent with our observation of apparent Mg deficiency.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Such systematic errors could explain the disagreement between the refined Mg-site occupancy ) and the slight Mg excess found in the chemical phase analysis for the single phase, or single phase region, of the phase diagram .	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, the Mg excess required for the single phase composition found in the phase analysis can also be accounted for by a slight loss of Mg during the synthesis.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This could occur due to volatilization and (or) reaction with oxygen (as was shown to occur in the time dependant investigation).	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Our overall conclusion is that a vacancy content of up to 1% at the Mg site cannot be ruled out.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	More importantly, the refined Mg site occupancy does not vary with starting composition; in particular there is no rapid change in site occupancy at or near x=1 that would indicate solid solution behavior over a small range of starting compositions.	0

P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The c-axis changes by almost a factor of 3.5 more than the a-axis, thus the c/a ratio mimics the change in the c-axis.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This rapid decrease in c/a at the nominal single phase composition could be interpreted as evidence for a Mg-vacancy solid solution region in the material, if one ignores the constant refined value for the Mg site occupancy.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, as will be shown, this anomaly in lattice constants is due to lattice strain, not any intrinsic stoichiometry variation in the MgB 2.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The profile refinement of the diffraction peak shape for the samples did not show any evidence for particle size broadening, however, strain broadening was observed.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The diffraction peak shapes were modeled in terms of an isotropic Gaussian strain broadening term (sig-1) plus an anisotropic strain broadening term (g1ec) that defines a small additional Lorentzian broadening along the c axis (These terms are defined in the GSAS manual.).	0

P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The c/a ratio and the c-axis lattice constant scale with the much larger isotropic strain broadening (sig-1).	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The behavior of the lattice parameters and peak broadening versus starting composition can be readily understood by realizing that the behavior divides into three smoothly connected regimes; a Mg rich region, a nearly stoichiometric region and a MgB 4 rich region.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the Mg rich region, above Mg 1.1 B 2 , the strain, both isotropic and anisotropic, is lowest and the lattice parameters display their intrinsic values.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this region, where a significant amount of Mg metal is present as an impurity phase, grain-interaction stresses among the randomly oriented MgB 2 crystallites are relieved.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Our hypothesis is that some of the Mg metal is distributed on the grain boundaries that separate individual crystallites, allowing stress relaxation on these boundaries.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We note a report of Mg in grain boundaries of sintered MgB 2 samples observed by analytical electron microscopy, consistent with this hypothesis.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the intermediate regime, from Mg 0.9 B 2 to Mg 1.1 B 2 , the amount of impurity phase, whether Mg metal or MgB 4 , is small enough that the behavior is dominated by grain interaction stresses among the randomly oriented MgB 2 crystallites.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Because of these stresses, upon cooling from the synthesis temperature, the MgB 2 crystallites are inhibited from realizing the full anisotropy of the intrinsic thermal expansion, which is twice as large along the c axis than along the a axis .	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Instead, the c-axis thermal expansion is slightly reduced and the a-axis thermal expansion is slightly increased.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This yields a slightly larger c axis and slightly smaller a axis, when compared to the strain-free values observed in the strain-free Mg-rich regime.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the composition region below Mg 0.9 B 2 , where the concentration of MgB 4 as an impurity phase is high, the material displays the behavior of an MgB 2 / MgB 4 composite in which the response of MgB 2 lattice and peak broadening parameters depends on the thermal expansion behavior of both components of the composite.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We, thus, conclude that the observed small variations in lattice parameters over the range of starting compositions studied results from the multiphase behavior of the samples and the resulting effects on grain interaction stresses, not on any variation of the stoichiometry of the MgB 2 phase.	0

P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The line through these data in is a least squares fit which is nearly horizontal indicating no variation of T c with phase fraction.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the Mg-rich region of the phase diagram, T c decreases continuously with decreasing MgB 2 phase fraction.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This behavior can't be explained by any variation in the intrinsic nonstoichiometry of the MgB 2 phase.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Additionally, there is no correlation between lattice strain and T c ; indeed, the Mg-rich region that shows a small, constant lattice strain has the largest change in T c .	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	One must conclude that T c is independent of strain.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A simple explanation for the observed T c dependence of the Mg content of the sample is that an impurity (or impurities) in the Mg incorporate into the MgB 2 phase and lower its transition temperature.	0

P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this region, the impurity content of the MgB 2 will increase linearly with Mg content and, assuming a linear dependence of T c with x, will lead to a linear suppression of T c as is observed.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Note that if the impurity responsible for the T c suppression was coming from the B, T c would remain constant in this region.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the MgB 4 (SL) + MgB 2 (SS) region the impurity content will decrease to zero as the Mg content decreases.	0

P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Equation is valid for x = 1 to x = c/(δ + c), the starting composition where the impurity content of the MgB 2 phase goes to zero and the T c becomes maximum.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus the T c maximum should occur in this two-phase, Mg deficient region.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Although the errors in the T c determination are large, the data in might suggest that the maximum T c does indeed occur at x < 1.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the MgB 2 + MgB 4 (SS) region of the phase diagram T c should remain constant since the impurity content would remain at zero and all of the impurity would be incorporated into the MgB 4 phase.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is consistent with the data in , which show a constant T c within the accuracy of the measurement.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The T c behavior would be quite different if B had been the host for the impurity.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	T c would be high and constant in the MgB 2 + MgB 4 (SS) phase region and show a decrease in the MgB 2 (SS) + MgB 4 (SL) phase region analogous to the case for Mg hosting the impurity.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, in the Mg + MgB 2 (SS) phase region T c would remain constant and suppressed.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, in our case the dominant effect on T c is due to impurity contamination from the starting Mg.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The actual behavior of T c will depend on the impurities present, their distribution in the starting materials, and the nature of the Mg-B-Im phase diagram for each particular impurity.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This could lead to very complex behavior of T c with starting composition depending on the number of impurities, their effect on T c and their interaction with the relevant boride phases.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In our case, the impurity content was low, and we could model the T c in a very simple way.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Ribeiro et.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	al. have shown that the T c of MgB 2 varies in a somewhat consistent manner with the claimed purity of the starting B, with the highest T c shown for material synthesized from the second -highest -clamed purity B (i.e. isotopic 11 B from Eagle-Picher, the same as used in this study).	0

P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The first class (Si, Fe) have large, random variations from the expected values.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	These elements most likely have large nonuniform distributions in the solid phase due to small diffusion constants at the low synthesis temperature.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The second group of elements (Ca, Mn, In) have values larger than expected.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	These elements have most likely been additionally doped into the material from external sources during the synthesis and handling procedures.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The last group (Zn, Pb, Al) on the other hand, have concentrations that scale in a manner consistent with the T c behavior, i.e. increasing impurity content as the Mg starting composition increases.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Zn and Pb actually follow the calculated impurity content fairly closely.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	These elements, being volatile, attain a uniform distribution in the solid phase, however, may not actually have been incorporated into lattice.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	None of these elements is likely responsible for the T c variation in the samples, the concentration is far too low.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Al, for example, would require almost 6000 ug/g for a 0.2K drop in T c based on the work reported in Ref. .	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Even though it may be impossible to identify the impurity responsible for the T c variation, the analysis shows that some dopants do follow the correct phase behavior.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In conclusion, we have shown that, for the synthesis conditions employed in this work (850°C in 50 atm.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Ar gas), MgB 2 is a line compound; i.e., it does not have variable composition.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The composition may be slightly (up to 1%)	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Mg deficient; however, other effects such as a failure of the Rietveld refinement to adequately model the anharmonic motion of B or chemical substitution on either the Mg or B site can mimic Mg vacancies in structure refinements.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this regard, we note that chemical substitution may provide an alternative explanation for the 4% Mg vacancy concentration observed in singlecrystal x-ray diffraction studies of MgB 2 crystals grown at high pressure from the Mg-B-N system.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In particular, incorporation of N at the B site would raise the x-ray scattering cross section of that site, leading to an indication of Mg deficiency in a refinement that assumed only B on the B site.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A more precise determination of the composition may be possible by exploiting the different scattering contrasts in a joint neutron and x-ray diffraction study or by pyctnometric measurements of the density of single crystals.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, achieving better accuracy than the present study will be difficult.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Although these results apply only to MgB 2 made under these synthesis conditions, they are likely to hold for other synthesis methods near the same range of temperature and pressure.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Moreover, this study illustrates the approach that must be taken to explore whether variable composition can be achieved by other synthesis methods.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	First, the synthesis technique must adequately approximate equilibrium conditions.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Second, all products of the synthesis must be accounted for in the analysis.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Phase rules can only be applied if these two conditions are satisfied.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We have also shown that small variation of lattice parameters with starting composition is not an adequate proof of variable composition in the MgB 2 phase.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the present study, small variations arise from grain-interaction stresses, which vary with the phase composition of the sample, leading to a rather complex behavior of the lattice parameters with starting composition.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We note that stress effects could be greatly amplified in samples made at high pressure because stresses introduced under high-pressure synthesis conditions, where strong sintering between grains occurs, may not be able to relax.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A small variation of T c with starting composition observed in the Mg-rich regime in our study can be explained in terms of accidental doping by an impurity in the starting Mg.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Accidental impurity doping has been observed previously in MgB 2 .	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For example, Ribeiro et al. reported rather large changes in T c depending on the purity of the starting B.[21] However, in both their study and ours, it has not been possible to identify the impurity or to quantify its concentration in the MgB 2 .	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A detailed interpretation of accidental impurity doping effects requires a knowledge of the ternary phase diagram for Mg, B, and that particular impurity.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We have shown in the present case that it is possible to hypothesize a phase diagram that is consistent with all experimental observations.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It may be possible to extend the concept of accidental impurity doping to develop methods for achieving deliberate chemical substitution in MgB 2 .	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For example, alloys of Mg might be used to incorporate other metals on the Mg site.	0
P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It has already been shown that BC can be used as a starting material to synthesize C-doped MgB 2-x C x .[4] Creative use of such ideas may provide a route for exploring chemically substituted MgB 2 in cases where other synthesis routes have failed.	0

P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is now generally agreed that the hole doped HTSC (HDHTSC) have a d-wave superconducting order parameter [1,2], show a normal state pseudogap for low hole doping [3] and exhibit a non-Korringa relationship between the Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate and the Cu Knight shift [4].	0

P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The one disadvantage of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is that it must be made using a high pressure synthesis technique and incorrect synthesis can lead to site disorder, the partial formation of the 1D antiferromagnetic insulator, SrCuO 2 , as well as the antiferromagnetic insulator, La 2 CuO 4 .	0

P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is interesting to compare this behavior to that in the HDHTSC, in which a very general trend has emerged.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In those materials the thermopower just above the superconducting transition temperature falls with a nearly constant (and approximately universal) slope .	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The magnitude near the superconducting transition temperature depends on the doping level, which has led to its use as a gauge of the hole concentration .	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The only superconducting cuprates to deviate from this general behaviour are those with conducting chains and/or ribbons, which are thought to make their own positive slope contribution to the thermopower .	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	An interpretation of this generic behaviour is available based on the doping dependence of the Fermi surface, and a conventional treatment of the charge carrying quasiparticles .	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Within this picture the thermopower is comprised of a diffusion contribution, linear in temperature with a sign and magnitude that is determined by the Mott formula, and a phonon drag contribution, S g , which is given by, Here a C is the volumetric heat capacity of the acoustic phonons, N is the concentration of carriers, e is the electronic charge, p W is the scattering rate for phonons and pe W is the contribution from events in which the phonons are scattered by electrons.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The sign and magnitude of the constant A is determined by a balance of scattering events in which the electron traverses filled vs. empty states in reciprocal space.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The generic behavior of the thermopowers in the HDHTSC then fits within this picture as being a contribution of a diffusion term and the temperature independent phonon drag contribution imposed by the heat capacity at temperatures above the acoustic phonon maximum.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This interpretation implies that there is no temperature dependence in the ratio p pe W W / , consistent with a picture in which the temperature dependent anharmonic phonon scattering does not significantly limit the phonon lifetime.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Similar behavior is occasionally found also in conventional metals , although it is more common to find that the phonon drag contribution falls as 1/T above the Debye temperature, where anharmonic scattering limits the phonon lifetime .	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, in conventional metals one usually finds a low temperature thermopower showing a linear temperature diffusion component and a cubic temperature phonon drag component, while at higher temperatures the drag contribution is inversely dependent on the temperature.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It can be seen in that the thermopower in the present case conforms to the more common behavior, for low temperatures, and, for high temperatures.	0

P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The high temperature 1/T attenuation of S g caused by the ratio p pe W W / is however weak, suggesting that even here the phonon lifetime is limited more strongly by electrons than by anharmonicity.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	There is no evidence of any deviation from the expected behavior that might suggest the development of a pseudogap.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Finally, we note that there is an earlier report of thermopower measurements on thin films of the EDHTSC, Sr 0.9 Nd 0.1 CuO 2 , where T c varied from 24 K to non-superconducting .	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In that report the thermopower data were also fitted to a sum of linear temperature and inverse temperature terms, though the temperature range chosen (<90 K) was inappropriate for assigning the inverse-temperature behavior to a phonon drag contribution.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Consequently, the conclusion that the low temperature thermopower data (<90 K) from the thin film samples implies phonon mediated pairing in the EDHTSC is also inappropriate.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We now consider the Cu NMR data.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We show in figure 2 that the room temperature Cu NMR powder spectra are narrow and nearly independent of applied magnetic field when scaled by the Larmor frequency.	0

P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The 63 Cu NMR spectrum at 14.1 T contains a narrow region of 1.4 MHz in extent and a broad weaker region extending to ±6 MHz.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is clear that the broadening of the central peak is little affected by second order nuclear quadrupole broadening in contrast to the HDHTSC.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is evident in where the 63 Cu NMR spectra taken at 8.45 T (filled circles) and 5.6 T (open circles), scaled by the applied field, are also shown.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It can be seen that that the widths are nearly the same, indicating that second order nuclear quadrupole effects are small.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The weaker broad signal is likely to be due to the +1/2↔+3/2 and -1/2↔-3/2 satellite transitions and a distribution of nuclear quadrupole frequencies.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We estimate, from the NMR spectra at different magnetic fields, that the average nuclear quadrupole frequency is less than 3 MHz.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is significantly smaller than that observed in the HDHTSC (16 MHz to 40 MHz ).	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However it is comparable to the upper estimate of the nuclear quadrupole frequency in superconducting samples of the EDHTSC, Nd 2-x Ce x CuO 4 (< 2 MHz ), and it is consistent with the estimates from two previous studies on Sr 1-x La x CuO 2 with x>=0.07 (<~3 MHz ).	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We show in that the 63 Cu NMR spectrum from a c-axis aligned sample at 9 T with c⊥B shifts to lower frequency for temperatures below T c and there is a significant increase in the linewidth as can be seen in the insert to figure 3.	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	An increase in the 63 Cu NMR linewidth is also observed in the HDHTSC and it has been associated with vortices in a type II superconductor and the formation of a flux lattice at low temperatures .	0

P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The 63 Cu NMR shift can be understood by noting that, for axial symmetry, the total NMR shift, δ α , of the central transition in an external field B directed in the α-direction with respect to the crystal frame shift can be written as, , where, α is ab for c||B or c for c⊥B, α ν ∆ is the shift in frequency from the Larmor frequency, 0 ν , ) ( , T K s α is the temperature dependent Knight shift, α , 63 orb K is the temperature independent orbital shift, α , dia K is the diamagnetic shift due to the superconducting screening currents and (2 ) , 0 / Q α ν ν ∆ is the second order nuclear quadrupole shift.	0

P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The second order quadrupole term in equation is large in the HDHTSC because of the large electric field gradient at the Cu nucleus and it can be the dominant term, leading to a NMR shift of up to 3.5 % for c⊥B. The subtraction of the large second order quadrupole, and the small diamagnetic term, at low temperatures leads to the orbital shift which, for the HDHTSC, is ~0.22 % in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 , ~0.22 % in Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ , and ~0.30 % in La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 [36].	0
P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	These values are very similar to the low temperature NMR shift from our Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 sample which, after correction from the small diamagnetic shift, is 0.21 % for c⊥B.

MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Even though the measured σ dc is in the range of ∼ 100 Ω −1 cm −1 and the observed σ 1 (ω) is the average between the ab-plane and c-axis conductivities, the sharp upturn in σ 1 (ω) toward σ dc at ω < 10 cm −1 indicates that the free carriers experience virtually no scattering (Γ ∼ 4 cm −1 ).	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This observation suggests that the extremely small fraction of free carriers participate in a coherent charge transport in La 1.985 Sr 0.015 CuO 4+δ.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The ǫ 1 (ω) of δ = 0.024 sample clearly reveals that the ω ∼ 23 cm −1 mode is a collective mode (ω GL ) and the 400 cm −1 is the corresponding single particle excitation gap (2∆).	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	One might consider that the origin of this collective mode is from a spin density wave (SDW).	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, in this event the entire spectral weight is expected to move to the collective mode of the SDW because the dynamic mass of the SDW is the free electron mass.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	That is, we do not expect to have the single particle excitation peak.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, this collective mode is resulting from the charge condensation into a one-dimensional or 2D density wave in the CuO 2 planes and this density wave is pinned as evidenced by the finite frequency of the collective mode.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The spectral weight distribution indicates that almost all the carriers introduced to the CuO 2 planes are spent to form a pinned charge density wave (CDW).	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since a pinned CDW is an insulator, 20 the pinned CDW itself cannot give rise to the observed nearly dissipationless metallic conductivity.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the coexistence of a pinned CDW and metallic conductivity demands a channel for coherent charge transport.	0

MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the case of a one-dimensional CDW, formation of topological charged solitons (phase kinks) is a possibility.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, because of the topological nature of the solitons, it requires that both soliton and antisoliton must hop to the neighboring CDW chains to transport charges.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the observed coherent charge transport will not take place through the soliton hopping mechanism.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the stripe model, each stripe in the CuO 2 plane is considered as a river of charge and conducting.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Hence, no charge gap or pinned collective modes are expected.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This point has been verified through the transport 24 and infrared studies of static charge stripes in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 systems.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, our observation bears neither the signature of the idea of strings of charges, either static or dynamic, nor the one-dimensional CDW's in the CuO 2 plane.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The other possibility is a 2D Wigner lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The observed data may imply that charges (holes in our case) added to the CuO 2 planes condense to form a 2D Wigner lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The repulsive Coulomb interaction between the holes at dilute concentration enables the holes to form a 2D square lattice in the CuO 2 plane.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this model, the ω = 0 Goldstone mode of the Wigner lattice has been shifted to ω GL ∼ 23 cm −1 due to the commensuration pinning of the Wigner lattice to the underlying CuO 2 lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Charge-lattice coupling would enhance the lock-in of the Wigner lattice with the underlying CuO 2 lattice 13 and stabilize the square lattice by lowering the total energy.	0

MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We can now formally relate our low temperature results to the high temperature special carrier concentration.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It seems that this instability survives to low temperature and we suggest that all the doped holes in the CuO 2 plane are condensed to form a (4x4) square Wigner lattice with sides L = 4a (a = Cu-Cu distance).	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Then, the observed sharp Drude-like free-carrier conductivity in this insulating Wigner lattice ground state comes from the coherent charge transport of the excess holes ∆p = p c ∼ 0.0005 per copper which corresponds to ∼ 0.8% of the total carriers in δ = 0.024 sample.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In order to achieve such a coherent transport of charges, the free-carriers must reside in a state where the scattering with the phonons of the CuO 2 lattice can be avoided.	0

MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In a square lattice model, when an excess hole is introduced to the Wigner lattice, it will find an energetically lowest location on the lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Because of the on-site Coulomb repulsion at the lattice sites, the minimum energy location would be the center of the square lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At this location, the excess hole seats in a local harmonic potential with a zero point energy.	0

MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This causes the zero point energy of the excess holes to be broadened into a band with the width of which is density dependent.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This band is gapped by the Coulomb interaction energy at the minimum energy site.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For charge carriers in the Coulomb band, the main energy dissipation channel for electrons is through the scattering with acoustic phonons of the Wigner lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At high temperatures, there exists possible promotion of holes from the Wigner lattice site to an interstitial position and vice versa.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A similar idea of an interstitial band has been discussed by de Wette for a three-dimensional electron Wigner lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this band picture, we anticipate two absorption peaks in addition to the transition across the single particle excitation gap: One due to the transition (ω 1 ) from the Coulomb band to the single particle excited state and the other involves the transition from the ground state to the Coulomb band (ω 2 ).	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, the ω 2 transition from the ground state to the Coulomb band requires an energy across the gap less the Coulomb energy change in the lattice which is essentially the same as the static Coulomb energy difference between the occupied lattice site and the interstitial lattice site.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We suggest that ω 2 is of the order of ∼ 0.012 eV (∼ 100 cm −1 ) as seen in the oxygen gas effusion experiments.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This implies that the Coulomb energy difference between the occupied lattice site and the interstitial lattice site is ∼ 0.025 eV. Therefore, we identify the 90 cm −1 peak with ω 1 with a full width W c ∼ 200 cm −1 (0.025 eV) and the Coulomb band gap is ∼ 300 cm −1 .	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Note that ω 1 and ω 2 are quite close.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The effective mass of the Wigner lattice (m * ) can be estimated by taking the ratio of the oscillator strength of the collective mode (S GL ) to that of the single particle excitation (S 2∆ ) calculated from the σ 1 (ω) and by applying the sum rule with and S other is the oscillator strength of all other excitations.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Using the experimentally estimated oscillator strengths, we found m * ∼ 170 m e at 300 K, ∼ 80 m e at 150 K and ∼ 60 m e at 30 K. This implies that the density waves develop the longrange order at T > 150 K by drawing its strength from the single particle excitations.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We shall see later in the oscillator strength vs. T plot that the crossover occurs at T 0 ∼ 200 K. However, we believe that m* is underestimated from the experimental data because the measured reflectivity for frequencies above 400 cm −1 is less than true reflectivity due to the ceramic nature of the sample.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In addition, symmetric band is assumed to take into account of the spectral weight above 0.5 eV. Fitting for each peak was made using a symmetric Gaussian function as an approximation without taking into account of asymmetry.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The Debye frequency (ω D ) of the Wigner lattice can be estimated within the harmonic approximation as ω D ≈ (e 2 /ǫ 0 m * L 3 ) 1/2 ∼ 42 cm −1 (∼ 7.8 x 10 12 s −1 ) which gives the Debye temperature (θ D ) of 60 K with ǫ 0 ∼ 10, the static dielectric constant of the underlying CuO 2 lattice, and m * ∼ 60m e .	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, we expect the linear T-dependence down to 0.2θ D ∼ 12 K 29 since the main energy dissipation channel for electrons is the scattering with the acoustic phonons of the Wigner lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Through the oscillator strength calculation, we found only ∼ 0.42 % of the doped carriers are contributing to the Drude-like conductivity at T = 300 K which is consistent with the value estimated from the plasma frequency.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is 50% of the available free carriers at p = 0.063 doping.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At 300 K, the other 50% may occupy the single particle excited states of the Wigner lattice that might contribute to the incoherent background conductivity.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The deviation from the linear T-dependence of the resistivity in under-doped cuprates is due to additional scattering with the lattice defects and domain boundaries whose fluctuation is dynamic as the Wigner lattice formation is not complete at finite temperatures.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	σ 1 (ω) of δ = 0.032 sample, which undergoes the superconducting transition at T c ∼ 26 K, is displayed in .	1
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For δ = 0.032 sample, there are two more structures in σ 1 (ω) in addition to those found in δ = 0.024 sample: A sharp peak at ω ∼ 46 cm −1 and a broader one peaked at ω ∼ 70 cm −1 .	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since we know that the δ = 0.032 sample is right at the fast transition region from a T c ∼ 15K state to a T c ∼ 30K state.	1
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is plausible that the observed σ 1 (ω) of δ = 0.032 sample comes from two different contributions; one comes from the T c = 16 K phase (LT c ) seen in δ = 0.024 sample and the other from the T c = 30 K phase (HT c ).	1
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Then, the two new features belong to HT c phase and have their origin in a different Wigner lattice ground state.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We identify that the ∼ 46 cm −1 mode corresponds to the collective mode of this new Wigner lattice, ω GH .	0

MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From the oscillator strengths of the Goldstone modes, one may determine the ratio of the carrier density in LT c phase (n L ) and HT c phase (n H ), n H /n L .	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At 30 K, we find n H /n L ∼ 2, which suggests that the carrier concentration of HT c phase is twice of that of the LT c phase when we assume the same m*. This implies that the HT c phase contains c(2x2) Wigner lattice, corresponding to p = 1/8.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	That is, the degree of commensuration has been decreased by a factor of two and the corresponding Goldstone mode ω GH = 2ω GL .	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We suggest that the physical origin of the so-called p = 1/8 anomaly lies in the fact that at p = 1/8, the entire holes in the cuprate participate in forming the HT c phase Wigner lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, we found n H /n L ∼ 1.2 at T = 300 K and ∼ 2.0 at 150 K suggesting that the HT c phase grows and builds up the long range order as T is lowered below 300 K. The ∼ 70 cm −1 peak in the HT c phase corresponds to the ∼ 90 cm −1 peak in the LT c phase.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this new lattice, the Coulomb band gap has increased slightly owing to the decrease in the lattice size of the Wigner lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Based on all the above observations, the normal state properties of cuprates are characterized as following:	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(1) Away from half-filling, the new ground state is the 2D Wigner lattice order state and there exists a Coulomb band.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Only a small fraction of carriers (∼ 0.42 % at 300 K and ∼ 0.97 % at 150 K) in the Coulomb band are participating in the coherent charge transport.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(2) Consequently, there exists two different types of gap; one is the single particle excitation gap at 2∆ ∼ 400 cm −1 and another is the Coulomb band gap on the order of 300 cm −1 .	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We believe this 2∆ is the gap seen in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), tunneling, and heat capacity measurements, which has been identified as the normal state pseudogap.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In particular, since the best spectral resolution of ARPES is ∼ 20 meV ( ∼ 160 cm −1 ), 30 the lower energy excitations than 2∆ have not been resolved in ARPES measurements.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, the observed states within the gap in other experiments have their origin in the density of states of the Coulomb bands.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(3) The Coulomb interaction between free carriers in the Coulomb band is governed by the di-electric function arising from the presence of the pinned Goldstone mode through Here, ω G is the Goldstone mode, n W is the carrier density in the Wigner lattice and ǫ 1 (2∆) is the contribution from the single particle excitation.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Having found that the ground state of cuprates away from half-filling is the Wigner lattice state and the long range Coulomb interactions among the excess carriers in the Coulomb band are massively screened by the presence of the Wigner lattice, any purely attractive interaction will induce the spin singlet pair formation which ultimately gives the superconducting order.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The interaction energy between two electrons can be calculated by considering the following Coulomb interaction matrix element between two holes, H 12 which takes the form Since the holes in the Coulomb band also oscillates in phase with the Wigner lattice at ω = ω G and 1/ǫ 1 ( q → 0, ω) ≈ 1 -ω 2 0 /( ω 2 G -ω 2 + ω 2 0 ) in the long wavelength limit with ω 2 0 ≡ 4πn W e 2 /m * , one immediately finds the range of ω where V = H 12 is attractive as ω G < ω < ω 2 0 + ω 2 G .	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Here we have ignored the contribution from the single particle excitation and the damping of ω G .	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Notice that this interaction is not retarded.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the free carriers in the Coulomb band already form pairs once the long range order of the Wigner lattice develops for temperatures below T ∼ ω 0 ∼ 215 K. Only when the photon energy greater than ω 0 (or T > ∼ 215 K), these preformed pairs dissociates via the Coulomb repulsion.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In fact, vortex-like excitations in La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 systems at T as high as 150 K have been observed in the measurements of the Nernst effect.	0

MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	There are evidences supporting that the phase stiffness of the superconducting order parameter Ψ ∼ ∆e iφ plays a crucial role in high T c cuprates.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Even though the pairing of the holes is achieved, the superconducting order will be obtained only after the long-range order in phase has been established.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In conventional BCS superconductors, because of the phase stiffness energy is much greater than the pair binding energy, the transition to the normal state is achieved by breaking the pair at T ≥ T c and the superconducting transition and pairing take place at the same temperature.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the original BCS theory, the derivation of the Meissner effect from the reduced BCS Hamiltonian is not gauge invariant.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From consideration of gauge invariance, pointed out that there exist collective excited states of quasi-particle pairs, which can be excited only by the longitudinal current associated with the longitudinal component of the vector potential.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, once the superconducting order has been established in ordinary BCS superconductors, the phase collective mode is present due to the broken gauge symmetry and the presence of such collective states is essential for the gauge invariance in the long wavelength limit (q → 0).	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Nambu found that the charge density correlation in the ground state is given by X(q, ω) ≈ n F q 2 /m e (ω 2 -n F q 2 / N(0) ) where n F = free electron density and N(0) = density of states.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the presence of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, the dispersion relation for the collective excitations can be determined from the secular equation, 1 -V(q)X(q, ω) = 0 with bare Coulomb interaction V(q) = 4πe 2 /q 2 .	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This secular equation gives ω φ 2 ∼ 4πn F e 2 /m e in q → 0 limit which is the plasma frequency of the electron gas.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This collective mode is known as the Bogoliubov-Anderson mode.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This mode shifts to the plasma frequency makes the observation of the phase collective mode impossible.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, for the case of the Wigner lattice ground state, we propose that one must consider the screened Coulomb interaction in the Wigner lattice ground state as instead.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This modification leads to the phase collective mode solution ω φ 2 ≈ ω G 2 / (1 + γ) in q → 0 limit with γ ≡ n W m e / n F m * for the electrons pairs in the Wigner lattice with ǫ 1 (ω) ≈ 1 + 4πn W e 2 / m * (ω 2 G -ω 2 ).	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This implies that the phase collective mode ω φ occurs when the pairs of electrons in 2D Wigner lattice undergo the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at T = T c .	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The temperature dependence of the oscillator strength of the Goldstone modes and the Coulomb bands of δ = 0.024 and δ = 0.032 samples, plotted in and respectively, are consistent with this picture.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Two main remarkable changes are clearly seen; one is a relatively abrupt increase in the oscillator strength at ∼ 200 K, common to all the peaks and the other is a sharp jump in the strength of the Goldstone modes, ω GL and ω GH , at their respective superconducting T c , one at 16 K and the other at 30 K. The increase in the oscillator strength of the collective modes at 200 K, indicates that the longrange order of the Wigner lattice starts to develop as evidenced by the reduction in their dynamic mass.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At the same time, the strength increase in the Coulomb band suggests that more carriers occupy the Coulomb band following the development of the long-range order of the Wigner lattice.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The corresponding free-carrier oscillator strength changes from ∼ 0.42 % at 300 K to ∼ 0.97 % at 150 K and to ∼ 1.18 % at 30 K in δ = 0.024 sample indicates that all the available free carriers are now occupying the Coulomb band and participating in the charge transport at T below 200 K. However, we do not observe the change in the free carrier plasma frequency because of the increasing static dielectric constant with decreasing T. In δ = 0.032 sample, the free carrier strength is ∼ 0.44 % of the total carrier at 300 K and ∼ 0.71 % at 30 K. At the same time, as demonstrated above, at the crossover temperature (T 0 ∼ 200 K) of the long-range order of the Wigner lattice, the free carriers in the Coulomb band start to form pairs.	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Subtle changes in the dρ/dT vs. T curves of both δ = 0.024 and δ = 0.032 samples at ∼ 200K has already been pointed out (see ).	0
MPL0150497-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The resistivity decreases faster and faster upon cooling below 200 K. Therefore, we have normal state pairs of holes formed at 200 K in our cuprate system.	0

P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This result clearly indicates that the phonon-impurity scattering and the phonon-carrier scattering are not the only scattering mechanisms to determine the phonon mean free path.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Based on the apparent similarity of the doping dependence of the phonon peak in κ ab , shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), one might naively conclude that the lattice disorders induced by Zn and Sr in the ab plane are very similar and that the κ ab (T ) behavior is essentially explained only by the lattice disorder; however, this is not likely to be the case, which can be understood by considering the nature of the impurity scattering and the additional charge carriers introduced in LSCO.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	First, it is important to notice that the low-T phonon peak in κ ab is suppressed slightly more quickly by Zn doping than by Sr doping.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the impurity-scattering scenario, it is difficult to conceive that the phonons are scattered more strongly in LCZO than in LSCO, because the atomic mass difference between Cu and Zn is much smaller than that between La and Sr.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In addition, the contribution of the phonon-carrier scattering, which exists only in LSCO, would cause the phonon peak in LSCO to be suppressed more quickly than in LCZO.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, the difference between the Sr-doping dependence and the Zn-doping dependence in κ ab (T ) at low temperature, which is opposite to the naturally expected trend, suggests that there are additional scatterers of phonons in the Zn doped samples.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is most likely that the additional scatterers in LCZO are of magnetic origin; magnons, which cause the hightemperature peak in LCZO, are an obvious candidate, and the magnetic disordering around Zn atoms may also cause some scattering of phonons through magnetoelastic coupling.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is useful to note that, as we mentioned in section III A, magnons are likely to be already responsible for the relatively small phonon peak in κ ab (compared to that in κ c ) in pure La 2 CuO 4.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Contrary to the relatively small difference in the phonon peak of κ ab between LSCO and LCZO, the suppression of the phonon peak of κ c is much quicker in LSCO than in LCZO; especially, the sharp suppression of the phonon peak from x = 0 to 0.01 is quite surprising and is the most striking observation of this work.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Apart from the impurity scattering, two different scattering processes of phonons are possibly responsible for the suppression of the c-axis phonon heat transport.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The first possibility is the magnon-phonon scattering.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This may partly play a role (particularly in samples where the long-range Néel order is established) in the c-axis phonon heat transport, although their role is expected to be minor because of the essentially two-dimensional nature of the magnons in the LCO system, which means that the magnons cannot effectively change the wave vector of the c-axis phonons.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The second possibility is the scattering of phonons caused by the static stripes that exist only in LSCO.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the following, we elaborate on this possibility.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is known that static spin stripes are formed at low temperatures in lightly doped LSCO.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	If the charges also form static stripes together with the spins, they certainly cause local lattice distortions.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Even if the charges do not conform to the static stripe potentials set by the spins, the spin stripes themselves may well cause local lattice distortions due to the magnetoelastic coupling; 33 this direct coupling between the spin stripes and the local lattice distortions is in fact very likely, because recently Lavrov et al. found that the spin-lattice coupling is very strong in lightly doped LSCO.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It should be noted that the local lattice distortions due to static stripes are not expected to scatter phonons when the stripes induce only static and periodic modulation of the lattice (which is in fact a kind of superlattice); however, possible disordering of stripes in the c direction can introduce rather strong scattering of phonons in this direction.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In fact, because of the weak magnetic correlations along the c axis, the stripes in neighboring CuO 2 planes are only weakly correlated or even uncorrelated, which is best evidenced by the very short magnetic correlation length ξ c in the stripe phase (usually smaller than the distance between neighboring CuO 2 planes) in the lightly doped LSCO.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We can further discuss the possible role of static stripes in the suppression of the phonon peak in κ ab of lightly doped LSCO.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Although the stripes are much better ordered in the ab plane than in the c direction, 6,7 there are two reasons that phonons in the ab plane are possibly scattered by the stripes.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	First, the static spin stripes were reported to be established at about 30 K to 17 K for x = 0.01 to 0.04 by the neutron measurements.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	These temperatures are very close to the position of the phonon peak .	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Near the stripe freezing temperature, local lattice distortions are expected to be well developed and yet are slowly fluctuating (or disordered), which would tend to scatter phonons.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Second, there is no evidence until today that well periodically-ordered static charge stripes are formed in lightly doped LSCO; instead, our charge transport data strongly suggest that the charge stripes exist in a liquid (or nematic) state.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	14 Such disordered state of charge stripes would tend to scatter phonons.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, it is possible that the static stripes also contribute to the scattering of phonons in the in-plane heat transport in LSCO, although their effect appears to be much weaker than that in the c direction.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We have measured the ab-plane and the c-axis thermal conductivities of lightly doped LSCO and LCZO single crystals.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is found that the low-temperature phonon peak is significantly suppressed upon Sr or Zn doping even at very low doping levels, and that the doping dependence show clear differences between the Sr and Zn dopants, and between κ ab and κ c .	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The experimental observations can be summarized as follows: (i) The phonon peak in κ c decreases much more quickly with Sr doping than with Zn doping.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(ii) On the other hand, the phonon peak in κ ab is suppressed slightly more quickly with Zn doping than with Sr doping.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(iii) At high temperature, the magnon peak in κ ab (T ) decreases much more quickly with Sr doping than with Zn doping; in fact, the magnon peak completely disappears in LSCO with x = 0.01, while it is still observable in LCZO with y = 0.04.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(iv) Rareearth (Nd or Eu) doping for LSCO (x = 0.12) enhances the phonon heat transport in both κ ab and κ c , and this is manifested in the re-appearance of the low temperature phonon peak, whose height is similar to that of rare-earth-free LSCO with x = 0.04.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Based on the peculiar doping dependences of the lowtemperature phonon peak, we can deduce the following conclusions for the phonon heat transport at low temperatures: (i) In the in-plane direction, disordered static stripes are probably working as scatterers of phonon (in addition to the Sr impurities and the holes) in LSCO, while in LCZO magnetic scatterings cause strong damping of the phonon transport, which overcompensates the absence of the stripe scattering.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(ii) In the c-axis heat transport, besides the possible contribution of the magnon-phonon scattering, strong disorder of the stripe arrangement along the c-axis is mainly responsible for the scattering of phonons.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The latter scattering mechanism naturally explains the strong damping of the phonon peak in LSCO, while allowing much slower suppression of the phonon peak in LCZO where there is no stripe.	0
P067104503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the effect of static spin stripes, which are formed in the lightly doped LSCO, appears to be most dramatically observed in the c-axis phonon heat transport.	0

P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8, the structural phase transition from the orthorhombic mid-temperature (OMT, space group: Bmab) to tetragonal low-temperature (TLT, space group: P4 2 /ncm) phase occurs at ∼ 70 K. Moreover, at low temperatures below the structural phase transition temperature, T d2 , the transport properties exhibit various anomalous behaviors, such as an increase in the electrical resistivity and decreases in the thermoelectric power and the Hall coefficient with decreasing temperature.	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, the intimate connection between the crystal structure, the electronic state and the suppression of superconductivity has attracted notice.	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Several years ago, a static stripe order of holes and spins in the CuO 2 plane was discovered from the elastic neutron-scattering experiment in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 with x = 0.12.	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The static stripe order is formed as the TLT phase appears.	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, they have proposed that the dynamical stripe correlations, observed in a wide range of hole concentration in the La-214 superconductors, are pinned by the TLT structure, leading to the appearance of the static stripe order and the suppression of superconductivity.	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8, such a static stripe order has not yet been found in the neutron scattering experiment because of the difficulty in the preparation of a large-sized single crystal of good quality.	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, it is thought that the static stripe order exists also in this system, taking account of the appearance of the TLT phase and transport anomalies below T d2 in the polycrystalline sample which are analogous to those observed in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 .	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Moreover, the observation of a magnetic order of Cu spins in the muonspin-rotation (µSR) measurements provides a strong circumstantial evidence in favor of spin stripe ordering in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8.	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Another interest in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 is that the effect of the Nd spin in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 on the formation of the static stripe order can be examined.	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is because Sakita et al. have pointed out that the behavior of the susceptibility of La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 is quite different from that of La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 even above T d2 , which suggests that the Nd moment may have a great influence on the formation of the static stripe order.	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Accordingly, the preparation of the high-quality single crystals of La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8 and the detailed study on the possible stripe order are of much importance.	0
P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Several attempts to grow single crystals of La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 by the traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) method have been reported so far.	0

The temperature dependence of Θ D (T ) on a larger scale is typical for cubic metals , showing a broad minimum at about 11.5 K with a value of Θ D (11.5 K) ≈ 190 K. Towards higher temperatures Θ D rises again to reach about 225 K at 25 K. Compared to other metallic pyrochlores, which have a Debye temperature of typically 300 to 400 K, Θ D in RbOs 2 O 6 is rather low, indicative of lower frequency phonon modes.	0

P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This observation reveals a new aspect of the physics of the cuprates and is the central result of this Letter.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Whilst various explanations for the magnitude of the KW ratio in heavy fermion systems have been proposed, including a strong frequency dependence of the quasi-particle self-energy and proximity to an antiferromagnetic instability , none have so far predicted deviations from a 0 as large as those found in the HTC.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is noted, however, that the effect of a strong momentum dependence in the scattering amplitude, thought to be a key feature of HTC , has yet to be taken into account and efforts to include such an effect could prove highly illuminating.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As one moves across the HTC phase diagram towards the Mott insulator at half-filling, one expects e-e scattering to become even more intense.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, the gradual evolution from quadratic to linear resistivity in HTC must somehow reflect the growing strength of e-e interactions as one approaches the Mott insulator from the metallic side.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As an indication of how rapidly the e-e scattering intensity might grow, we note here that ρ ab of La 1.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 4 is ≈ 2 -3 times larger than that of La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 at 300K, even though the Luttinger sum rule dictates that their carrier densities differ by only a few percent.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Moreover, given the relatively minor changes observed in the phonon spectra as a function of doping, one does not expect the strength of the e-ph interaction to change forcibly across the phase diagram.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, since e-ph scattering appears to give a negligible contribution to ρ ab (T ) in La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 , it seems highly unlikely now that e-ph scattering can in any way account for the linear resistivity that appears (in a narrow composition range) around optimal doping.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the light of these results, we conclude that chronic (Umklapp) e-e scattering processes must dominate the normal state transport behavior of the cuprates across the entire accessible doping range.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Such a scenario is consistent with the large increase in the quasi-particle lifetime below T c observed in thermal and electrical conductivity measurements.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Finally, let us comment briefly on the Wilson ratio R W .	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As shown in the upper inset to , χ(T ) displays significant anisotropy with respect to the field orientation (believed to arise from anisotropic g-values ) and a strong enhancement at low T .	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Assuming a constant Pauli susceptibility χ p and an isotropic Curie-Weiss term (with Θ C ∼ 7.5K), we obtain an average χ p ∼ 1.75× 10 −4 emu/mol and hence, R W ∼ 2.0, consistent with values for other strongly correlated metals .	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	If however, all the enhancement in χ(T ) is assumed to be intrinsic, i.e. due to an enhanced χ p (T ), we obtain R W ∼ 3.5.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We note here that whilst a large enhancement in χ p (T ) at low-T would imply a similar enhancement in γ(T ), such behavior would be difficult to discern from our C(T ) data due to the dominant phonon contribution.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In summary, detailed low-T transport and thermodynamic measurements in La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 have revealed for the first time that LSCO develops a highly correlated FL ground state beyond the superconducting dome.	0
P068100502-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The observed enhancement in the KW ratio suggests that e scattering in non-superconducting LSCO is much more intense than previously imagined and raises serious question marks over previous claims that the ubiquitous linear resistivity observed in optimally-doped cuprates is a signature of (strong) e-ph coupling.	0

This phenomenon was also observed in the Y Sr 2 Cu 2.7 F e 0.3 O 7+δ superconductor 25 and in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ superconductor 27 obtained by high oxygen pressure synthesis.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In these superconductors, the diffraction peaks of (006) and (200) shift systematically to higher angle degree with the increase of oxygen content, which is similar to our results.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	All our HP-samples have smaller lattice parameters a and c than the corresponding AM-samples, and the lattice unit cell of HP-samples displays an obvious shrinkage.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since the relative shrinkage is not more bigger than other samples annealed under high oxygen pressure, and also for that F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ sample can be made superconducting without high pressure synthesis, thereby this shrinkage can be attributed to the increase of oxygen content, but not the pressure effect caused by the high pressure synthesis procedure.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Then it can be deduced that in all F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 (Ba 1−x Sr x ) 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ samples the oxygen content increased after high pressure synthesis, which is validated by the oxygen content measurement in F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ system where 7+δ increased from 7.20(2) in AM-sample to 7.35(2) in HP-sample.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The increased oxygen content provided the required charge which made the semiconducting-like AM-samples changed to superconducting HP-samples.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The diffusion of F e atom into CuO 2 planes in R-123 systems is believed to be very unfavorable for superconductivity because of its magnetic moment, and with the increase of F e concentration, this diffusion is inevitable in samples synthesized by common solid-state reaction 36 .	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	J. Shimoyama et al. 26 used a complex annealing procedure which is believed to suppress the incorporation of F e to the CuO 2 planes in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ system, and finally made it superconducting with T c ∼ 60K.	1
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Using neutron powder diffraction studies, T. Mochiku et al. 27 investigated the site-mixing between F e and Cu atoms in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ samples synthesized through different procedures, and proved that simply increasing the oxygen content could not produce superconductivity and the ordered distribution of F e and Cu atoms between Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites is also one of the key points to the origin of superconductivity.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In our heavily F e-doped R-1212 systems, high pressure synthesis procedure is believed to promote the transfer of F e atoms from Cu(2) site to Cu(1) site, and to make almost all the F e atoms to occupy the Cu(1) chain site.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This redistribution of F e atoms is a needed requirement to ensure the occurrence of superconductivity, while the increase of oxygen content provides the needed amount of charge.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The annealing experiments of F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ and F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ superconductors indicate clearly that the concentration of oxygen content affects superconductivity in HP-samples directly.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since annealed under the temperature as low as 290 o C during a short time of 2 hours, the occupation site of F e atoms could not be changed, but superconductivity in these superconductors was destroyed sharply.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The local region XRD patterns in indicated that the lattice parameters increased rapidly with the increase of annealing temperature below 400 o C, which suggested the release of oxygen content, and this was the main reason for the loss of superconductivity.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	After the discovery of F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ and F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ superconductors, there is a doubt that the superconductivity in these superconductors is possibly from δ phase formed by phase segregation.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is known that Y Sr 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ superconductor with T c = 30-80K can be obtained also by high pressure synthesis and its superconductivity disappears after heat treating at 300-500 o C. Although the single phase of XRD pattern results and high superconducting volume fraction of these superconductors have excluded these disputes, the achievement of F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ superconductor and the similarity of its superconductivity to those of F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ and F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ superconductors eliminate this doubt.	1
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The annealing experiments also eliminate the possibility that the superconductivity in F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ HP-sample is from Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ phase due to phase segregation, since it is well known that the superconductivity in Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ can not be destroyed by annealing at the temperature of 200-500 o C and the T c of Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ obtained by high pressure synthesis is 92K 35 .	1
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The discovery of these heavily-substituted superconductors with magnetic metal of F e atoms provides new platforms to investigate the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity and the correlation of magnetism and superconductivity, and it seems that we need to reconsider the influence of magnetism on superconductivity.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	of superconductors with high F e concentration F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Ba 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ , F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ and F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 Sr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ were successfully prepared by solidstate reaction and high pressure synthesis.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The high pressure synthesis resulted in the increase of oxygen content and redistribution of F e and Cu atoms between Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites, which are two key factors for the occurrence of superconductivity.	0
P069014507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The annealing experimental results indicate these clearly and eliminate the doubt of superconductivity relative to possible secondary phase of Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ , Y BaSrCu 3 O 7−δ or Y Sr 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ superconductors.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The role of substantial in-plane disorder (Zn) on the transport and AC susceptibility of Y 1-x Ca x Ba 2 (Cu 1-y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ was investigated over a wide range of planar hole concentration, p. Resistivity, ρ(T), for a number of overdoped to underdoped samples with y ≥ 0.055 showed clear downturns at a characteristic temperature similar to that found at T * in Zn-free underdoped samples because of the presence of the pseudogap.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Contrary to the widely observed behavior for underdoped cuprates at lower Zn contents (where the pseudogap energy increases almost linearly with decreasing p in the same way as for the Zn-free compounds), this apparent pseudogap temperature at high Zn content showed very little or no p-dependence.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It also increases systematically with increasing Zn concentration in the CuO 2 planes.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This anomalous behavior appears quite abruptly, e.g., samples with y ≤ 0.05 exhibit the usual T * (p) behavior.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Pure Y123 with full oxygen loading (δ=0), is only slightly OD, further overdoping is achieved by substituting Y 3+ by Ca 2+ 13,14 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The advantages of using Zn are: (i) It mainly substitutes the in-plane Cu(2) sites, thus the effects of planar impurity can be studied and (ii) the doping level remains nearly the same when Cu(2) is substituted by Zn enabling one to look at the effects of disorder at almost the same hole concentration 15,16 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Most of the studies on the effect of Zn on charge transport of Y123 are limited to the range of UD to optimum doping levels and at a moderate level of Zn substitution.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, study of the system in the OD region with high levels of planar defects fills an important gap.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This PG-like feature is almost independent of oxygen deficiency (δ), indicating that it is induced by disorder and not by changing the hole concentration p.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Various normal and SC state properties including T * (the PG temperature) are highly sensitive to p and, therefore, it is important to determine p as accurately as possible.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We have used the room-temperature thermopower, S[290K], which varies systematically with p for various HTS over the entire doping range extending from very underdoped to heavily overdoped regimes 18 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Previous studies, following the findings of Obertelli et al. 18 , showed that S[290K] does not vary significantly with Zn in Y123 for δ < 0.5 16,19 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Accordingly, in this doping range S[290K] is still a good measure of p even in the presence of strong in-plane potential scattering by Zn 2+ ions.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Using p-values from S[290K] and the experimental values of T c , a very good fit of T c (p) of the form of eq.(1) was obtained for all the samples.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	There is a systematic shift of p opt towards higher values (from p opt = 0.16 for the impurity-free case) and an increase in Z with increasing Zn content.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	These findings have important consequences.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Increasing Z(y) implies the shrinkage of the p-range over which the compound is superconducting upon Zn substitution, and the shift of p opt (y) towards higher values implies that the superconducting dome is displaced asymmetrically towards the overdoped side.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This latter feature, we believe, is indicative of a fundamental difference between the underdoped and the overdoped regions, namely the existence of the pseudogap in the underdoped region and its absence in the overdoped region 21 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From Fig.1 it is also seen that SC is at its strongest at p ~ 0.186, as this remains the last point of SC at a critical Zn concentration (defined as the highest possible Zn concentration for which SC just survives considering all the possible doping states).	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This has been reported earlier in other studies and the value p ~ 0.19 is indeed a special value at which the PG vanishes quite abruptly 4,14,19,21-24 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	T c was obtained from both resistivity and low field (H rms = 0.1 Oe; f = 333.3 Hz) ACS data.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	T c was identified at zero resistivity (within the noise level of ± 10 -6 Ω) and at the point where the line drawn on the steepest part of the diamagnetic ACS curve meets the Tindependent base line associated with the negligibly small normal state (NS) signal.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Resistivity was measured using the four-terminal configuration.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In previous studies 4,17,19,24 we have analysed ρ(T,p) of a large number of Y 1-x Ca x Ba 2 (Cu 1-y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ sintered and c-axis oriented thin films with y ≤ 0.05 and found the pseudogap temperature, T * (p), to be independent of Zn content and independent of the crystalline state of the compound (which also implies that T * (p) does not depend on the properties of the grain boundaries).	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We have also found clear indications that T * (p) vanishes at p = 0.19 ± 0.01 in these samples from our magnetic and transport measurements 14,19,24 , consistent with the findings from the specific heat measurements by Loram et al. 3,23 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	ρ(T,p) of two heavily disordered Y 0.80 Ca 0.20 Ba 2 (Cu 1-y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ sintered samples is shown in Fig.2.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As is standard practice 2,25 , we have taken T * as the temperature at which resistivity starts to fall at a faster rate with temperature than its high-temperature T-linear behavior 25 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is clearly seen from Fig.2a that the evolution of ρ(T,p) for the first y = 0.06 sample (S1) is different compared with other Y 1-x Ca x Ba 2 (Cu 1-y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ compounds with y < 0.05 (shown in	1

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this (S1) sample, there is a very large residual resistivity, also the maximum T c has been suppressed by ~ 57.1 K from its Zn-free maximum value (~ 85K), indicating that a large amount of Zn resides in the CuO 2 planes.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Even at fairly high hole concentration, (p ~ 0.180) ρ(T) is non-metallic over the whole experimental temperature range from 300K, indicating significant carrier localization induced by Zn in the CuO 2 plane and also due to some extrinsic effects like the degree of porosity of the sintered sample.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The most striking feature of the ρ(T,p) data is the downturn in resistivity at around 230 ± 5K, almost independent of planar hole concentration p.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This downturn is somewhat masked for samples with higher oxygen deficiency (smaller p) due to the stronger non-metallic behavior over the whole temperature range.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	These downturns in the ρ(T) data are similar to those observed in samples with a PG (see Figs.3).	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	But in this sample it is unusual because (i) the PG-like feature is observed in resistivity for a heavily overdoped sample (T c = 12K, whereas T cmax ~ 27.9K for y = 0.06) and (ii) T * does not seem to change with p. The former indicates the possibility of disorder giving rise to this PG-like phenomenon, whereas the latter shows that in such a case, this feature is almost independent of planar hole content, p. In Fig.2b we have shown the p-independent T * for another heavily disordered compound (S2) from the ρ(T) measurements.	1
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Although the nominal composition for S2 from a different batch was also y = 0.06 and x = 0.20, from the value of T cmax (= 32K) we think the actual Zn concentration in the CuO 2 plane is a little lower, probably ~ 5.5%.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	T * for this sample is ~ 205 ± 5K.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Several ρ(T) measurements were done for these samples after each oxygen annealing and measurements were also repeated after time intervals of several months.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Each time we have observed the characteristic downturn in ρ(T) at the same temperature.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is worth mentioning that for a given value of p, ρ(T,p) of S1 appears to be more non-metallic than S2.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We believe this is not intrinsic, but that it is related to the different level of porosity of the samples, and likely to be governed by the difference in their densities .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The density of S2 (5.93 gm/cc) was larger than that of S1 (5.61 gm/cc).	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is also supported from the	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	values of T cmax of the samples that are well explained by the small difference in the actual levels of Zn in the CuO 2 planes.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Extrinsic properties, like the quality of the conductivity at grain boundaries, can have a large effect on ρ(T) without having a * is seen again at 250 ± 5K.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From the reported 28 values of oxygen deficiencies for this film, we estimate the hole concentrations to be in the range p = 0.17 to 0.11 (within ± 0.01).	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At this point it is important to notice that resistivity of this crystalline thin film is not affected by the presence of significant grain boundary resistance.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This illustrates the role played by Zn as the principal source of disorder giving rise to the appearance of this PG-like feature in these samples.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It also appears that T * in these heavily disordered samples is determined by the amount of Zn in the CuO 2 plane.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For example, we have T * = 205 ± 5K, 230 ± 5K, and 250 ± 5K for samples with ~ 5.5%Zn, 6%Zn, and 7%Zn respectively.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, ρ(T) of 4%Zn substituted samples shows the usual T * (p) behavior as was found for the Zn-free samples (see Fig.3b).	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This indicates that the presence of a disorder induced PG temperature is a non-linear function of Zn concentration and, at least in the ρ(T) measurements, it reveals itself only in the highly disordered state.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We discuss the possible implications and origins of this anomalous PG in the next section.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The AC susceptibility (ACS) (expressed in µV/gm) for both S1 and S2 is shown as a function of p and magnetic field in Fig.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	First, the magnitude of the low-field ACS signal at low-T is largely reduced for the y > 0.05 samples and shows a strong p-dependence, namely the ACS signal reduces rapidly with the decrease of hole content in the UD side.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Both these features are absent for other samples for up to 5%Zn concentration (see Figs.5a and 5b).	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Second, the field dependent ACS signals as a function of temperature show the same qualitative features for both the sintered pellet and powder for S1 (see Figs.4c and 4d), showing the absence of any coupling T c and also the absence of any intergrain contribution to the shielding current.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The reduction in the normalized ACS signal in powdered sample simply implies that grain size is further reduced due to grinding.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The rapid reduction of the low-field ACS signal with increasing underdoping in S1 and S2 suggests that the superconducting volume fraction decreases rapidly with decreasing hole concentration.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Whereas for a less disordered sample (Fig.5d), the field dependent ACS clearly shows the intergrain shielding component and the grain-coupling temperature (T coupling ) 29 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Zn is believed to destroy superconductivity and superfluid density on a local scale (of the order of in-plane superconducting coherence length, ξ ab ) 30 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This seems to agree with ACS data for up to 5%Zn substitution where the low-field bulk ACS signal showed little variation with Zn and the entire volume of the sample contributes to the ACS signal at low-temperature.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is possible that for heavily Zn-substituted samples the effect is not local any more and some kind of phase segregation (between superconducting and nonsuperconducting regions) over a macroscopic length scale takes place.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Alternatively, the superfluid density in these highly disordered samples can be extremely low 31 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At temperatures near T c , the temperature derivative of the ACS signal for the powdered samples can be used to estimate the zerotemperature superfluid density, n s0 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The temperature derivative of the ACS signal can be used to represent the quantity N[a 2 n s0 ]/[15T c ] 32 , where N is a constant depending on the shape of the grains, and a denotes the average grain size.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In our calculations we have assumed N and a to be the same for all samples under consideration.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is a reasonable approximation because these compounds had nearly identical density and grinding of the pellets was done in exactly the same manner.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We have calculated the fractional suppression in n s0 as a function of Zn content for 3%Zn and 6%Zn substituted samples with p = 0.20 ± 0.005 (therefore, similarly heat treated).	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The results are as follows, [n s0 /T c ] y=0.03 /[n s0 /T c ] y=0.0 = 0.48 and [n s0 /T c ] y=0.06 /[n s0 /T c ] y=0.0 = 0.07.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, n s0 /T c for the 6%Zn sample is reduced to just 7% of its value for the Zn-free case at the same hole content.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	One possible reason for this small field broadening for the highly disordered sample could be due to the presence of unusually strong pinning in this compound.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The bulk of this 6%Zn sample contains significant parts which are poorly conducting and can act as a source of strong vortex pinning similar to the intrinsic pinning observed in high-T c cuprates when flux-flow in the poorly conducting c-direction is greatly blocked by the poorly conducting charge reservoir layers.	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Ca x Ba 2 (Cu 1-y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ is surprising considering the widely held belief that the energy scale of the PG is determined by p, and T * (p) either falls below or merges with the T c (p) line in the OD side.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In a previous magnetic susceptibility study, Cooper and Loram 34 observed a PG-like feature in fully oxygenated sintered 7%Zn-Y123, where superconductivity was almost completely suppressed with Zn.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Vobornik et al. also observed a pseudogap in ARPES experiments for disordered optimally doped Bi-2212 single crystals 35 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For Bi-2212, in-plane disorder was introduced by electron irradiation and T c was reduced from 90K to 62K.	1
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	ρ ab (T) was also measured but no high-T downturn in resistivity for this 62K optimally doped Bi-2212 was found 35 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	"In the light of present results, a possible reason might be that the sample was not ""sufficiently"" disordered, since we also did not see any anomalous effect in our 3%, 4%, and 5%Zn samples (where T c was suppressed by ~ 30K, ~ 40K, and ~ 46K respectively, near the optimum doping)."	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Notice that all the previous observations of disorder induced PG were for samples that are slightly OD 34 and optimally doped respectively 35 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Here we have reported this effect over a fairly wide doping range from p = 0.205 to 0.11.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	"It is fair to say that there are two main effects of Zn substitution for Cu(2) in cuprates 4,19,28,36,37 : (i) Zn tends to localize carriers in the CuO 2 plane (depending on temperature and Zn content) and (ii) it gives rise to ""Curielike magnetic moments"" possibly on the four neighboring Cu sites (in the presence of short-range antiferromagnetically correlated background)."	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Recent 63 Cu NMR 38 and inelastic neutron scattering studies 39 suggest that Zn enhances the AF correlation in Y123.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	There is growing evidence that an AF background with short-range order does not exist in overdoped cuprates with p > 0.19 4 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The situation in highly disordered samples could be different, especially if there is phase segregation, and only a very weak form of superconductivity is present.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Under these circumstances Zn induced enhancement of short-range AF correlation might be a possibility for highly disordered Y 1-x Ca 1-x Ba 2 (Cu 1y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ irrespective of the hole content.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is very interesting to note that both the effects of Zn substitution	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	c (p) are detrimental to each other and the growth of one is accompanied by the decrease of the other (at least in the pure compounds).	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Kohno et al. 45 have in fact shown in their theoretical analysis that disorder can indeed strengthen one competing phase (AF) significantly over the other (e.g., superconductivity).	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The abrupt appearance of this anomalous PG-like feature in resistivity as a function of disorder content is indicative of some sort of threshold mechanism in action, consistent with some recent theoretical studies 5,46 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	"For example, in the study by Monthoux 5 it was shown that as quasiparticle life-time becomes shorter (with increasing scattering by spin fluctuations), it starts to ""feel"" long-range magnetic order even when only short-range correlations are present."	0

P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As the quasiparticle life-time decreases with Zn, it is possible that at a certain level of Zn in the CuO 2 plane the scattering rate becomes high enough to dominate over the more gradual p-dependent scattering.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Using the Hubbard model, it was shown that a high scattering rate leads to the removal of low-energy spectral weight 46 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this scenario the local Coulomb repulsion, U, is the important parameter.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Heavy Zn substitution increases the scattering rate, localizes quasiparticles and effectively enhances U/t (where t is the nearest-neighbor hopping energy) globally.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Once U > 8t, the pseudogap becomes insensitive to U and therefore, should not show significant pdependence 46 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Roughly speaking, the mean distance between Zn impurities, l i , in the CuO 2 plane is given by ~ r/√z pl , where z pl = 3y/2 and r ~ 3.9Å is the distance between Cu atoms in the plane.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For y = 0.06, l i ~ 13Å, close to the value of the in-plane superconducting coherence length, ξ ξ ξ ξ ab ~ 15 Å. This should imply that once the distance between Zn atoms becomes comparable with the superconducting coherence length, abrupt changes in the various normal and superconducting state properties take place.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Another strong possibility is that this apparently anomalous PG is completely different and independent from its conventional counterpart.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The systematic behavior of T c (p,y) (see Fig.1), irrespective of Zn content, supports this assumption.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this situation a conventional T * (p) should still exist for highly disordered samples.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Here a much stronger resistive feature due to the anomalous PG could obscure the features associated with the conventional T * (p) which can be detected from the ρ(T,p) for less disordered compounds.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have observed PG-like features in highly disordered Y 1-x Ca x Ba 2 (Cu 1-x Zn x ) 3 O 7-δ from resistivity measurements.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Contrary to the situation for UD cuprates, the PG temperature showed almost no p-dependence over a large range of hole content.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The results reported here lend support to the ARPES works on optimally doped Bi-2212, where spectroscopic features of the electronirradiated compound looked similar to those of UD samples 35 .	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The ACS data of these heavily disordered compounds shows the superfluid density to be extremely low.	0
P071184510-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Magneto-transport data provide a preliminary indication of strong pinning of vortices, possibly because significant part of the heavily disordered bulk remains poorly conducting at low temperature.	0

P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is plausible that the decrease of T c with pressure in the HTT phase is primarily due to the negative dT c /dP associated with c-axis compression [11, 14, 15].	0

P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The lower maximum T c for La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 may be an effect of the increased disorder 10 associated with Nd substitution, although a similar maximum value of T c has also been observed [11-13] for La 1.875 Ba 0.125 CuO 4 under hydrostatic pressure.	0

P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A second possibility is that the pressure in that study was not fully hydrostatic, yielding an exceptionally rapid increase of T c .	0

A linear extrapolation of the data in reference [15] suggests that a uniaxial pressure of ~0.5 GPa along the (110) direction would increase T c to 22 K, the value we observe under a hydrostatic pressure of 5.0 GPa.	1
P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	If the uniaxial pressure suppresses the LTT phase in favor of the HTT phase, then the data in reference [15] suggest that a uniaxial pressure of only 0.5 GPa in the (110) direction is sufficient to accomplish this structural transformation!	0
P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Structural 11 measurements under uniaxial compression using single crystal x-ray or neutron diffraction are necessary to test this possibility.	0
P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The maximum T c of 22 K is found in the HTT phase of La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 .	1
P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This conclusion is consistent with results for La 1.88 Ba 0.12 CuO 4 [4, 11], as well as with other observations that suggest the highest superconducting transition temperatures occur when the Cu-O planes in lanthanum cuprates are flat, that is there are no tilt distortions [24].	0
P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Within the stripe scenario, the HTT structure has no pinning potential in the Cu-O planes to lead to charge ordering and consequent suppression of superconductivity.	0
P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In addition, there is no Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction in the HTT phase, and the interlayer magnetic exchange is fully frustrated.	0
P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus the HTT structure should provide the most homogeneous and magnetically isotropic environment of the four tilt structures listed in Table I.

P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	If so, this would provide indirect evidence for residual charge order in the HTT phase of La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 .	0
P071104513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This type of data has been presented [13] for La 2x Ba x CuO 4 , and does show a local minimum of T c at x = 1/8.	0

P069184513-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This paper describes a microwave technique that directly measures the small volume near the surface that is field-penetrated in the Meissner state, rather than inferring λ from a measurement of the very large volume that is field-free (see ).	0

P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The reason why the superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation is realized in a sample with the static stripe-ordered region is still an open question.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A possible origin is that the out-of-plane superconducting coherence length, ξ c , might be relatively large under the influence of the correlation of the static stripe order along the c-axis, leading to the three-dimensional superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Next, we discuss the relation between the change of the normal-state behavior of ρ ab in magnetic fields and the field-induced stripe order.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Considering the results of the elastic neutron scattering measurements mentioned in Sec. I, the negligibly small increase of ρ ab below T d2 with increasing field for x = 0.11 and 0.12 seems to indicate that the stripe order is nearly perfectly stabilized in zero field and is insensitive to the applied field.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As for x = 0.10, the marked increase of ρ ab below T d2 with increasing field reminds us some possible origins.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The first is the normal-state magnetoresistance.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, this is not applicable, because the normal-state magnetoresistance is usually as small as an order of 1 % at 15 T, as in the case of x = 0.11 and 0.12.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The second is the suppression of the superconducting fluctuation by the applied field.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The positive magnetoresistance appears even at temperatures just below T d2 far from T onset c in high fields.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, reports on the Nernst effect in LSCO have suggested that the vortex state survives even at higher temperatures far above T c , meaning that the superconducting fluctuation exists even at high temperatures.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, this possible origin cannot be excluded and further measurements are needed to conclude.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Nevertheless, it appears that this is not a candidate, because the large positive magnetoresistance is observed only for x = 0.10 and not for x = 0.11 nor 0.12.	0

P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	duced by the applied field.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The localization behavior of ρ ab becomes marked with increasing field and appears to approach the behavior of LNSCO with x = 0.12 where the stripe order is perfectly stabilized.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the long run, the most probable origin is that the charge-spin stripe order is stabilized by the applied field in x = 0.10.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This may be the first experimental evidence, to our knowledge, of the charge stripe order stabilized in magnetic fields.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	To be more conclusive, the neutron scattering measurements in magnetic fields are under way.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Finally, we discuss the temperature dependence of ρ ab below T d2 .	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	So far, it has been clarified in the underdoped LSCO and BSLCO that ρ ab in the normal state shows the ln(1/T ) dependence at low temperatures in magnetic fields, suggesting that the ln(1/T ) dependence is a common feature of the underdoped high-T c cuprates.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	To check this suggestion, ρ ab 's of LBCO with x = 0.10, 0.11 and LNSCO with x = 0.12 at 15 T are plotted versus lnT , as shown in .	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Below ∼ 20 K, it is found that ρ ab in the normal state is proportional to ln(1/T ) in each x, though ρ ab deviates downward from ln(1/T ) at low temperatures because of the superconducting transition for x = 0.10 and 0.11.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The small deviation below 3 K for x = 0.12 is irrelevant to the superconducting transition, because ρ ab is independent of the field strength for H ≥ 11 T, as seen in .	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The slope of the ln(1/T ) dependence is found to increase with increasing x, indicating that the localization of holes becomes strong with increasing x toward x = 1/8 at 15 T. The ln(1/T ) dependence is known to be characteristic of the weak localization and the electron-electron interaction in the two-dimensional Anderson-localized state where the in-plane electrical conductivity σ ab actually changes in proportion to ln(1/T ) even in magnetic fields.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For x = 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12, however, σ ab does not show the ln(1/T ) dependence below T d2 , as in the case of the underdoped LSCO.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Although the true origin of the ln(1/T ) dependence of ρ ab is not clear, the localization of holes with the ln(1/T ) dependence observed widely in the underdoped high-T c cuprates is robust even in the stripe-ordered state of LBCO and LNSCO.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	V. SUMMARY It has been found that the superconducting transition curve shows the parallel shift by the application of magnetic field in LBCO with x = 0.11 and LNSCO with x = 0.12 where the charge-spin stripe order is formed at low temperatures.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	These suggest that both the superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation and the static stripe order are realized in one sample for x = 0.11 and 0.12.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For LBCO with x = 0.10, the broadening in low fields changes to the parallel shift in high fields above 9 T. Moreover, ρ ab in the normal state below T d2 increases with increasing field up to 15 T. It is possible that these pronounced features of x = 0.10 are understood in terms of the field-induced stabilization of the charge stripe order.	0
P071104516-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The ρ ab in the normal state at low temperatures has been found to be proportional to ln(1/T ) for x = 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12, suggesting the localization of holes with the ln(1/T ) dependence of ρ ab which is robust even in the stripe-ordered state of LBCO and LNSCO.	0

P068132507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The first similarity is that the compound has a layered structure composed of twodimensional (2D) CoO 2 planes, separated by a thick insulating layer of Na ions and water molecules.	0
P068132507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As is widely known, high T C cuprates have also layered structures with 2D CuO 2 planes which play an essential role in the high T C superconductivity.	0
P068132507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The second similarity is related to valences and spin states of the transition metals.	0
P068132507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The Cu ions of the high T C cuprates are of mixed-valence states by hole doping; Cu 2+ (S=1/2) ions are partially oxidized to Cu 3+ (S=0) ions.	0
P068132507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In a similar way, the Co ion in the Co oxide is either Co 4+ (d 5 ) or Co 3+ (d 6 ) with a spin state of S=1/2 or S=0, respectively, assuming lowspin configurations.	0

P068132507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, as seen in , high-field magnetization increases linearly with increasing field above 15 T. Thus, if the Curie-Weiss-like upturn is caused by the magnetic impurity, its magnetization must be saturated above 15 T. In other words, the slope of the magnetization above 15 T should be equal to the magnetic susceptibility corresponding to the Pauli paramagnetism terms.	0
P068132507-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, the value of 4.9 × 10 −4 emu/mol, which was calculated from the slope of the magnetization between 15 T and 30 T, is different from 3.02 × 10 −4 (= χ 0 + A × 4.2 2 ) emu/mol, obviously beyond experimental uncertainty.	0

P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We have measured the specific heat and magnetization versus temperature in a single crystal sample of superconducting La2CuO4.11 and in a sample of the same material after removing the excess oxygen, in magnetic fields up to 15 T. Using the deoxygenated sample to subtract the phonon contribution, we find a broad peak in the specific heat, centered at 50 K. This excess specific heat is attributed to fluctuations of the Cu spins possibly enhanced by an interplay with the charge degrees of freedom, and appears to be independent of magnetic field, up to 15 T. Near the superconducting transition Tc(H=0)= 43 K, we find a sharp feature that is strongly suppressed when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the crystallographic c-axis.	1

P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	One of the features in the specific heat of our superconducting sample La 2 CuO 4.11 is the absence of a clear magnetic contribution at the simultaneous ordering temperature of 42-43 K.

P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We suggest, instead, that the excess specific heat shown in comes from a change in the spectrum of spin excitations resulting from the doping.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The contribution of the spins to the specific heat in the 2D S= 1 2 square lattice Heisenberg AFM (Quantum Heisenberg Antiferromagnet QHA) become important at temperatures of order the in-plane exchange constant J. Monte-Carlo simulations of this model show that the heat capacity exhibits a broad peak at k B T ≃ 0.6 J .	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since the excess specific heat reported here is observed at 50 K, ascribing the excess specific heat to that of a QHA would imply that J is suppressed from ∼ 135 meV to ∼ 7 meV by doping.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, this conclusion contradicts results from neutron scattering.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The instantaneous magnetic correlation length, measured by integrating over all the energies up to ∼ 100 meV is almost constant as a function of temperature in the optimally-doped or slightly underdoped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 .	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	1 If J were in fact reduced by doping to 7 meV, then the correlation length would rise dramatically at low temperatures.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Although the instantaneous correlation length has not been measured in oxygen-doped La 2 CuO 4+y , its magnetic dynamics is very similar to slightly underdoped LSCO.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Furthermore, we have measured the widths in q-space of the magnetic fluctuation peaks associated with the SDW order and find no increase in their width up to ∼ 9 meV. This allows us to place a lower bound on J in the superconductor of 60 meV. We conclude that the excess specific heat is not described by the QHA with reduced J.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Neutron scattering results show that the ordered moment below the SDW transition increases dramatically with the application of a magnetic field.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	9 However, the excess specific heat, aside from the small component resulting from superconductivity, does not depend on the applied field.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This and the absence of any critical behavior convince us that the observed anomaly cannot be attributed only to the fluctuations of the ordered magnetic moment near the SDW phase transition.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We would not expect such a contribution since the nearest-neighbor spin correlations are already established at much higher temperatures, and hence there would not be enough excess entropy at 50 K to observe experimentally.	0

P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The latter shows a maximum as the energy transfer is lowered, at around 7 meV, before going to zero at lower energy.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This maximum is most pronounced near the superconducting transition temperature.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This behavior shows that there is an enhancement of the (π, π) spin fluctuations at ∼ 7 meV in La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 of similar hole density to the La 2 CuO 4.11 sample studied here.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The suscep-tibility around (π, π) of La 2 CuO 4.11 does not show such a maximum, but rather is approximately constant at low energies.	1
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For the latter material χ ′′ (ω) is enhanced at low energies relative to that in La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 because of the magnons associated with the static long-range-ordered incommensurate SDW.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, muon measurements indicate that the local magnetic order is fully developed microscopically at only about 40% of the muon sites.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The remaining 60% of the sample, which has a very small ordered moment, is likely to have spin excitations closely similar to those in La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (x=0.14) and should exhibit the enhanced spin fluctuations at around 7 meV. We speculate, therefore, that the broad anomaly in the specific heat reflects the enhanced magnetic fluctuations coming from the disordered 2D spin-1 2 system.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Naively, one expects the entropy associated with these fluctuations to be even smaller than the contribution from the moments that order below 42K.	0
P069174506-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Consequently, the large enhancement of spin fluctuations observed in the experiments must the result of an interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the following we will show that the field dependent slope of the linear part in low temperature region shown in directly deviates from the Simon-Lee 18 scaling law.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	According to Simon-Lee scaling law C vol /T √ H = f (T / √ H), in low temperature region, the Volovik's relation restores, thus one has C vol /T = A √ H and further has This clearly shows that there is a negative slope for ∆γ vs. T , but the slope α is a constant.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, from one can see that the slope changes slightly with the magnetic field H. This indicates that only the Volovik's relation is not enough to interpret the data.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the following we will take both the core size effect and finite temperature effect into account.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The former has not been considered in the original Simon-Lee scaling law since the size of the vortex core was thought to be small, and the contribution from that small region is negligible.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	If the vortex core size becomes bigger, this should be reconsidered when counting the DOS due to the Doppler shift effect.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	A linear behavior is clearly seen in low temperature region with a field dependent slope, which is not in accord with the proposed scaling law by Simon and Lee (see text).	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The straight lines in low temperature region are guides to the eyes.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From these lines one can determine the zero temperature intercept ∆γ and the slope d∆γ/dT shown in Fig.5 low temperature limit and high temperature limit suggested by Volovik and Kopnin 21 , making Taylor's expansion to the right hand side of Simon-Lee scaling law leads to where b 0 = 0 because C vol /T should not diverge when T = 0 and H = 0, b1 = A. Since o(T 3 ) is very small in low temperature region, one thus has Interestingly, one can see that this simple formula contains the results both in the low temperature limit C vol = b 1 T √ H 15,16,31 and high temperature limit 21,31 C vol = b 2 T 2 .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is not surprising since a scaling function should be more general and cover most possible cases.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	When H c1 << H << H c2 , the total specific heat contains four parts: Doppler shift term from the region outside the core C vol , the inner vortex core term C core ∝ HT , the residual linear term γ 0 T and the phonon term C ph .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Here it is assumed that the heat capacity contributed by the core region is equal for each vortex and independent on the external magnetic field, thus C core depends only on the vortex density which is proportional to H. The local DOS measured by STM 26 revealed that the low energy DOS within the vortex core differs only slightly from the case for a d-wave superconductivity (outside and far away from the vortex core).	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	When changing the external magnetic field, the low energy DOS within the vortex core is not expected to vary too much.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At zero field, the total specific heat contains three parts: γ 0 T and C ph , and a quadratic term αT 2 due to the thermal excitation near the nodal region.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The intercept and the slope of the dashed line give rise to the pre-factors of the second and third terms in eq.7 From eq.5 one can see that ∆γ depends on T through the second term, however the slope b 2 − α is still field independent by definition.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This clearly indicates that the Simon-Lee scaling law is still not enough to interpret the field dependent slope of ∆γ vs. T as shown in .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Let us keep going, still based on eq.5, we propose that the core size effect may have a sizable influence on the total vortex quasiparticle excitations.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is actually reasonable since the vortex core with size ξ ∝hv F /∆ s grows up in the overdoped side due to smaller superconducting gap value 32 , where v F is the Fermi velocity and ∆ s is the superconducting gap.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	By taking the vortex core size (2ξ) into account, i.e., deducting the normal core area away from the Volovik term, one can rewrite ∆γ as where ξ is the radius of the normal core, R a is the outer radius of a single vortex where the supercurrent is flowing, thus R 2 a = φ 0 /πH. Reorganizing all terms in eq.6 leads to One can see that the third term in eq.7 is just what we need for interpreting the difficulty as mentioned above.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is necessary to recall that the core size correction is proportional to ξ 2 , for example, it will be four times when ξ doubles.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus increase of ξ in the overdoped side will give sizable effect on the total DOS and core size effect should be considered.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The results are quite close to each other by using these two different methods.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The solid line in is a fit to the data using the first term in eq.7 yielding b1 = 1.995 ± 0.046mJK −2 T −1/2 and πξ 2 /φ 0 = 0.012 ± 0.003 and thus ξ = 28.2Å.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The value ξ = 28Å derived here is quite close to that found in Nernst 33 and STM measurements 26 (20Å for optimally doped Bi-2212 sample).	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We also tried to use the first term together with the last term to fit the data but find out that the contribution from the last term is extremely small.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The first term here describes the zero temperature data very well, indicating the absence of a second component of order parameter such as id xy or is since otherwise the Fermi surface would be fully gapped and the Doppler shift had very weak effect on the quasiparticle excitations.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The inset of shows the field dependence of the slope of the linear part in .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is clear that the slope increases roughly linearly with H above 1 T. This can be exactly anticipated by the second and third terms in eq.7.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From the inset of By taking ξ = 28.2Å, we obtain the following values: α = 0.501mJmol −1 K −3 and b 2 = 0.196mJmol −1 K −3 .	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since the contribution from the core region (last term in eq.7) is negligible comparing to the Volovik term, from eq.7 one understands that the failure of using the Simon-Lee scaling law in very overdoped sample is due to the core size effect.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is actually quite reasonable since the core size in the overdoped region grows up.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Sofar we don't know yet whether the negligible contribution from the core region is because of the gapped feature within the core region as found in optimally and underdoped samples , or it is naturally small comparing to the contributions from the Doppler shift effect of the surrounding superfluid.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Furthermore, the formulism considering the impurity effect does not predict a field dependent slope for the linear relation ∆γ vs. T in low temperature region.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore together with the extremely small Γ/∆ 0 found in present case, we believe that the field induced DOS in our sample comes mainly from the Doppler shift effect on supercurrent outside the cores.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Clearly the scaling looks very poor.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From above discussion, we conclude that the failure of the Simon-Lee scaling law in the very overdoped region is due to the quite large vortex core size which needs to be corrected.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The nice fit in with only the first term of eq.7 suggests that the core region has very small contribution to the DOS since otherwise the last term b core H should be sizeable.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The slight scattering or deviation from the main scaling branch is due to the simple assumption made for the core size correction (1 − ξ 2 /R 2 a ) and the rough estimation for α value.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Worthy of noting is that to have this nice data collapsing and consistency with the theoretical curve we need to take b core ≈ 0, again showing a small contribution from the inner vortex core.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The nice data collapsing using eq.8 suggests that the Simon-Lee scaling law can be reconciled by considering the vortex core size effect.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is interesting to note that the electronic thermal conductivity derived by Sun et al. is not consistent with the Volovik's expression in low temperature region for the overdoped sample, rather it shows a plateau when the field is high.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	So far we don't know the reason for this discrepancy.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For our extremely underdoped sample (x = 0.063) investigated here, although the data at finite temperatures cannot be treated with the Simon-Lee scaling law, the data in the low temperature limit T → 0 can be however still nicely expressed by γ(H, T = 0) = γ 0 + A √ H, even the absolute increase of γ(H, T = 0) by field is much smaller than γ 0 .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the field induced part is mainly contributed by the Doppler shift effect on the supercurrent outside the vortex cores, while the residual linear term γ 0 is mainly contributed by some small normal regions which weakly depends on the magnetic field.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Similar explanations to the origin of γ 0 have been suggested for many times in the past .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This may be understood in the following way.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In underdoped Bi − 2212 single crystals, scanning-tunnelingmicroscopic (STM) measurement indeed reveal a mixture of superconducting regions with sharp quasiparticle coherent peaks on the tunnelling spectrum, and the nonsuperconducting regions with pseudogap-like tunneling spectrum 50 .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the overdoped side, the tiny normal cores as proposed in the Swiss cheese model 51 , or the mesosscopic normal regions suggested by Fukuzumi et al. and Wen et al. will contribute a residual term γ 0 which does not show an apparent increase with the field.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As proposed by Fukuzumi et al. that the dome-like electronic phase diagram may be formed by the mixture of three phases: anti-ferromagnetic phase in the extremely underdoped region, a d-wave superconducting region with the robust superconductivity near the optimal doping point and a non-superconducting Fermi liquid in the overdoped region.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	According to this simple picture the γ 0 should increase in the underdoped and overdoped region, which is just the case as shown by the data in .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore we would argue that the residual linear term may be mainly contributed by some non-superconducting regions due to phase separation, either chemical or electronic in origin.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This interesting argument needs certainly to be further checked with data obtained by different techniques on different systems.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In above analysis, we concentrate on the data below 10 K ( below 6 K for the very underdoped sample).	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is also the temperature region that most of the low temperature specific heat data was reported in the literatures.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Although the data are strongly scattered one can still see that: (1) The field induced change ∆γ becomes negative at about 0.5 − 0.7T c ; (2) The curves have a similar shape: ∆γ is positive in low temperature region, then it becomes negative and finally comes back to zero in high temperature region (near T c for optimal and overdoped sample).	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For the overdoped sample, the ∆γ keeps negative above 0.5T c until T c at which ∆γ suddenly goes back to zero.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For the optimally doped one, the ∆γ is negative above about 0.7T c up to the highest temperature we measured here .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However for the underdoped sample, it shows that the ∆γ keeps negative until 1.5T c .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Similar data were obtained by Fisher et al. on samples with x = 0.15.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Our data near T c is more scattered since our setup can only measure samples with maximum mass of 50 mg.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This feature, namely the negative ∆γ in high temperature region is a consequence of entropy consideration, which has been observed in all types of superconductors.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In low temperature region, when a magnetic field is applied, vortices will be generated leading to higher DOS near Fermi surface, so that ∆γ = γ(H) − γ(0) is positive.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	When the temperature is increased, to satisfy the field independent entropy above T c , in a certain region below T c , ∆γ should be negative.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The most interesting point is for the underdoped sample here, even above T c one clearly sees a magnetic field induced change of entropy.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This implies an abnormal normal state which is far from a conventional metal.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For a conventional swave superconductor, the field induced change of γ can be negative near T c .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is difficult to understand the field induced reduction of specific heat well below T c , since the normal core region always gives rise to a higher DOS of quasiparticle.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Outside the vortex core the DOS is almost negligible.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However this field induced reduction of specific heat well below T c is found to be a general feature of all LSCO crystals we investigated so far.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This may be related to the intrinsic properties of cuprate superconductors.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In a d-wave superconductor, theoretically it is predicted that there is a ZBCP within the vortex core which should also contribute a quite high DOS in the mixed state.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Besides, a high DOS will be generated by the Doppler shift effect of the supercurrent surrounding the vortex core.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Normally the sum of these two terms are larger than the zero-field term C DOS = αT 2 , leading to a field induced enhancement of DOS in low temperature region.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	When the temperature is high, the Doppler shift effect will be smeared out by the strong thermal excitation and finally ∆γ becomes negative.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As far as we know, no quantitative theoretical expression about ∆γ has been reported so far for a d-wave superconductor in wide temperature region.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We cannot have a quantitative understanding to our data.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, this field induced reduction of specific heat well below T c may be understood as due to the anomalous feature of vortex core state, i.e., a gapped vortex core as seen by the STM. , or based on the assumption that the contributions from the core region is much smaller than the outside region where either the Doppler shift or the strong thermal excitation dominates.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Actually the Simon-Lee scaling law becomes a C vol ∝ T 2 relation in high temperature region.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this case the quasiparticle excitation outside the vortex core is almost the same (αT 2 ) with or without applying a magnetic field.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However since the vortex core region is gapped or contributes negligible part to the total DOS, one needs to take the core region away from the total area in calculating ∆γ, naturally leading to a negative value of ∆γ.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In low temperature region, our analysis indicates that the field induced quasiparticle DOS can be well described by Volovik's theory or Simon-Lee scaling law although a correction due to the core size effect is needed for the overdoped sample.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This means that the prerequisite for the theory, i.e., the d x 2 −y 2 pairing symmetry is well satisfied.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore it naturally rules out the presence of a second order parameter like id xy or is either due to overdoping 6 or due to the field effect 54 in all samples investigated here.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Meanwhile, for the overdoped sample, another interesting phenomenon is that the vortex core region contributes very little (at least much smaller than that induced by the Doppler shift if the super-current would flow in the same area) to the total DOS.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We have also tried to analyze the data of the optimally doped and underdoped sample in the way as that for overdoped one, for example to fit the data in and to the first term in eq.7.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The negligible contribution from the vortex core region may suggest that the ZBCP is absent within the cores, even in the overdoped region.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This suggestion inferred from the specific heat measurement about the ZBCP within the vortex core is consistent with the tunnelling results and certainly clears up the concerns about the surface conditions in the STM measurement.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Recent results from NMR also show the absence of a ZBCP inside the vortex core .	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this sense our data together with the earlier NMR data present a bulk evidence for an anomalous vortex core.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is interpreted as due to the presence of a second (gapped) order like AF or SDW or DDW within and nearby the vortex core.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The data measured on polycrystalline samples are somewhat smaller, which is perhaps induced by the random orientation of the grains.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For some grains the field is not parallel to the c − axis leading to a smaller contribution to the field induced change of γ.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	tration monotonously.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This can be understood in the following way: by increasing doping the normal state value γ n will increase 56 , the H c2 will drop down (at least it is the case in the overdoped region).	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore A-value will increase monotonously in the overdoped side.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	One can see from the data that the A-value keeps almost constant in the extremely underdoped region, which means that γ n and H c2 should both decrease with underdoping.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This indicates that the H c2 becomes smaller and the coherence length ξ becomes larger towards more underdoping.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is consistent with the recent conclusion drawn by Wen et al. by analyzing the data about the low temperature flux dynamics.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is found that the field induced DOS of the optimally doped sample fits the predicted Simon-Lee scaling law for a d-wave superconductor very well, while deviations have been found for the overdoped sample.	0

P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We attribute this to the appearance of a second competing order (like AF or SDW or DDW) within and nearby the vortex core.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The negligible contribution from the vortex core region may suggest the absence of the ZBCP in the vortex core, even in the overdoped region, although it is expected by the Bogoliubov de-Gennes theory for a d-wave superconductor.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Finally we present the doping dependence of the residual linear term γ 0 commonly observed in cuprate superconductors.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is argued that this linear term may be related to inhomogeneity (either electronic or chemical), rather than be simply explained as due to the small scale impurity scattering as usually thought.	0
P070214505-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This conclusion is made because the field induced extra DOS at zero temperature follows the Volovik's √ H law reasonably well in all doping regime.	0

JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The NCCO sample synthesized under reducing conditions with maximum Ce content possesses a high density electron concentration.	0
JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, the Sr0.18͑O͒ sample prepared under an oxidizing environment apparently overcompensates the electron density generated through Ce incorporation, thereby leading to a high density of hole concentration and thus behaving in an almost opposite manner to the NCCO sample as far as the phonon-drag part is concerned ͑Fig.	0
JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	3͒. The small although negative values of S encountered in the case of the Sr0.18͑O͒ sample beyond the crossover at about 100 K indicates the dominance of the electron contribution in the diffusive thermopower region.	0
JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	TEP, particularly that contributed from normal electrons S that is also the case in the present study, is related to the circulatory ( j ) and electronic ( e ) heat conductivities 21 where ⌬(T) is the energy per normal carrier relative to the superconducting carriers.	0

JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In other words, thermal conductivity associated with the sharp peak in the Nd 2Ϫx Ce x CuO y system is extraordinarily large compared to that in p-type cuprate superconductors.	0
JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This characteristic may also be compared with the TEP dips ͑or peaks͒ observed in the present samples as these features are found in the temperature range where thermal conductivity also peaks.	0

JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We also note that the nonlinear S(T) is associated with the decrease in dip as the Sr concentration (x) increases.	0
JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The dip decreases slowly with the introduction of superconductivity and may be correlated to the increased disorder due to the increased x. It is therefore tempting to say that the thermopower of NSCCO is something more than the sum of diffusion and phonon-drag components as it is in the Nd 2Ϫx Ce x CuO y system.	0
JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Presumably both electrons and holes take part in the conductivity of ͑NSCCO͒ materials.	0

JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	On the other hand, the Nernst effect of the same thin film composition in the mixed state was found to arise from the motion of the vortices in response to thermal force, and it is anomalously large.	0

JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, in doing this, one should consider the contrasting features of the semiconductinglike behavior in the resistivity data and the metalliclike small magnitude of thermopower in the oxygenated samples.	0
JAP0805169-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this situation, one may visualize the resistivity and thermopower arising from conduction by metallic and semiconducting bands in parallel, with the contribution of the semiconductor band to the total conductivity being small.	0

JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	While the above form is valid for h < 0.25 or h > 0.7, a more useful approximation valid for an arbitrary field is σ In both cases, λ is related to the superconducting carrier density n s as indicating that λ is enhanced upon the reduction of n s due to the quasiparticle excitations.	0

JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In a preliminary analysis, we found that the spin relaxation rate due to the FLL formation is less than 0.1 µs −1 which is typically of the same order of magnitude as that due to static random local fields from nuclear magnetic moments.	0

JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	To this end, the following equation was used in the actual fitting analysis of the time spectra, where σ 0 is the relaxation rate due to the nuclear moments and ν is the power of relaxation.	0

JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	According to the empirical two-fluid model approximately valid for conventional BCS superconductors, we have which leads to where t ≡ T /T c (0.1 T).	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The fitting analysis by the same formula with an arbitrary power, with T c as a free parameter yields β = 2.8and T c = 0.65(3) K. We also found that T c = 0.62(1) K when β = 4 is assumed, which is slightly lower than the value T c ≃ 0.7 K estimated from the specific heat measurement for this field.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Although the difference is not obvious between these cases (solid curve for β = 2.8 and the dashed curve for β = 4) in , we note that the reduced χ 2 for the former is almost two times smaller (better) than the latter.	0

JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, it is concluded that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is a typical type II superconductor with large λ, which is consistent with the results of magnetization measurement.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The finding that β ≃ 2.8 may indicate that the deviation ∆λ = λ(t)−λ(0) ∝ T β exhibits a tendency predicted for the case of line nodes (d-wave pairing) with some disorder (i.e., dirty limit), where ∆λ ∝ T 2 .	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	[18] Such a temperature dependence has actually been observed in high-T c (YBCO) cuprates.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Compared with the case of isotropic gap ∆k = ∆ 0 , the quasiparticle excitations are enhanced along nodes (|∆k| = 0) to reduce average n s , leading to the enhancement of λ.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, the result of the fitting analysis also suggests that the discrepancy may be attributed to experimental uncertainty including the precise value of T c .	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, we are led to conclude that the order parameter in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is mostly isotropic with a possibility of residual weak anisotropy as suggested by the slightly reduced value of β.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	As shown in (a), σ decreases with increasing external field, where the general field dependence is determined by the increasing contribution of normal vortex cores and the stronger overlap of field distribution around the cores which are described by the term (1−h) in eq.(0.6).	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The fitting analysis by eq.(0.6) with H c2 and λ(H = 0) as free parameters yields H c 2 = 0.37(5) T and λ(H = 0) = 796(12) nm at 0.2 K. Since the deduced value of H c2 is consistent with that obtained from the magnetization measurement (≃ 0.29 T), we can conclude that the observed field dependence of λ is mostly due to the vortex core/overlap effect, except for the fields below ∼0.06 T where a slightly steeper reduction of σ is suggested.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The penetration depth deduced for each field using eq.(0.6) with H c2 = 0.37 T is plotted in .	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In order to evaluate the relative strength of the pair-breaking effect, it is useful to introduce a dimensionless parameter η to describe the field dependence of λ with the following simple linear relation, where h ≡ H/H c2 (0.2K) with H c2 (0.2K) = 0.37 T. From the analysis of data in	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	), we find that η = 0.38(14) with λ(0.2K, 0) = 741(5) nm for 0 ≤ H ≤ 0.06 T. In general, the field dependence of λ is enhanced by two different mechanisms, i.e., the nonlinear effect in the semiclassical Doppler shift of the quasiparticle energy levels due to the supercurrent around the vortex cores, and the nonlocal effect which further modifies the quasiparticle excitation spectrum in the momentum space.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In particular, the nonlocal effect is important in the system with line nodes because the coherence length is inversely proportional to the order parameter, such that ξ 0 (k) =hv F /π∆k.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The divergence of ξ 0 along the nodal directions |∆k| = 0 means that the response of quasiparticles near the nodes is highly nonlocal.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is predicted that η ≪ 1 for the isotropic s-wave pairing because the finite gap prevents the shifted levels of quasiparticle excitations from being occupied at low temperatures.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is supported, for example, by the recent observation in CeRu 2 , in which η ≃ 0 over the field region 0 ≤ h ≤ 0.5 where the system behaves more or less as a conventional BCS superconductor with isotropic s-wave pairing.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	[21] On the other hand, stronger field dependence is predicted for the case of d-wave or anisotropic s-wave pairing due to the excess population of quasiparticles in the region where |∆k| is small or zero.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Typical examples for the d-wave pairing are those of high-T c cuprates in which η is reported to be 5∼6.6 for YBCO.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Meanwhile, in the case of an s-wave superconductor YNi 2 B 2 C in which strong anisotropy for ∆k is suggested experimentally , η ≃ 1 is reported from a µSR study.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The comparison of these earlier results with our result suggests that the anisotropy of the order parameter in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is considerably smaller than YNi 2 B 2 C.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Finally, we comment that the recent observation of a clear coherence peak below T c in the 187 Re NQR measurement does not necessarily indicate the absence of anisotropy in the order parameter.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the case of the anisotropic energy gap, the magnitude of the coherence peak depends on the mean free path l. The coherence peak is enhanced in a certain condition of l where quasiparticles probe only a limited region of the Fermi surface.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, while the actual value of l is difficult to estimate because of the semimetallic character of this compound, the NQR result does not completely rule out the presence of anisotropy in general.	0

JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Re 2 O 7 by µSR.	0
JPS0710709-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The temperature and field dependence of the London penetration depth indicates that the basic feature is consistent with the isotropic order parameter for BCS s-wave pairing, although there remains a certain subtlety suggested by the small deviation from the theoretical prediction which may be better understood by considering a weak anisotropy.	0

JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The LaSrAlO 4 substrate has a slightly smaller inplane lattice constant than those of bulk La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 , which results in the in-plane compression and the out-ofplane expansion of the La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 film.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The rapid increase of T c has been ascribed to such an epitaxial strain effect.	0

JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This strong dependence of T c on anisotropic pressure was also directly demonstrated by a recent uniaxial pressure measurement .	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Our observation of distinct differences between the inplane and the out-of-plane pressure effects agrees well with these observations.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The most remarkable result here is the substantial difference between the [100] direction and the [110] direction, both within the CuO 2 plane.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This is the first observation of an in-plane anisotropic pressure effect in high-T c cuprates.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Only when the pressure is applied along [110] do we see a strikingly large increase of T c with increasing pressure.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Indeed, the application of only several kbar causes T c to almost double.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In contrast, when the pressure is applied along [100], only a small change in T c is observed.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This implies that the in-plane pressure effect cannot be simply described by a superposition of pressure effects along two orthogonal directions but strongly depends on the symmetry of strains induced.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This novel anisotropic pressure effect is visually summarized in .	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Note that the increase of T c with P/[110] upon pressure, dT c /dP [110] ∼ 2.5 K/kbar is even larger than observed on La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 around x ∼ 1/8 with hydrostatic pressure , previously the largest pressure effect ever observed in high-T c cuprates.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We ascribe this striking in-plane anisotropy to the intimate coupling between the one-dimensional stripes and an anisotropic lattice distortion within the CuO 2 planes.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The stripes are running along either [100] or [010], switching alternately from plane to plane along the c-axis .	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Note that the [110] direction is rotated 45 degrees to the stripe directions.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Since the symmetry of strain induced by the [110] pressure does not match with those of the one-dimensional stripes, it appears natural that the [110] pressure suppresses stripe formation and therefore enhances superconductivity.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The [100] pressure, on the other hand, is parallel or perpendicular to the stripes, which gives rise to an orthorhombic strain matching with the local symmetry of stripes within each CuO 2 plane.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The [100] strain therefore might not be so detrimental to stripe formation.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In addition, the 90 degree rotation of the stripe direction from plane to plane may act to cancel out the [100] strain effects.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Such an intimate link between the symmetry of strain and the stripes may become even clearer by considering the presence of the LTT distortion, an alternate tilting of the CuO 6 octahedron along the stripe direction, that is known to stabilize stripe formation.	0

JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The tilting angle decreases upon Sr doping and, eventually at the critical angle, drives the stripe magnet into SC.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The strain, at 45 degrees to the stripe direction [100] or [010], very likely reduces the LTT tilting angle because of the symmetry mismatch.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This decrease of the tilting angle will shift the phase boundary between stripes formation and superconductivity to lower x and will substantially enhance T c of the sample in the critical region.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From these considerations, we believe that the extremely large uniaxial and anisotropic pressure effect within the CuO 2 planes in La 1.64 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.16 CuO 4 is realized by an intimate interplay of the strain-stripe coupling mediated by the lattice distortion and the stripe criticality.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The remarkable uniaxial pressure effect observed in this study should help to clarify the longstanding issue of the interplay between stripes and high temperature superconductivity and, as a result, might shed new light on the high-T c problem.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	First, by checking for this anisotropy, we may identify the contribution from the stripes and particularly dynamical stripes to superconductivity itself.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Indeed, uniaxial pressure measurements are now under progress on samples with Sr content x away from the critical composition x = 0.16, in order to explore the influence of dynamical stripes.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Second, using [110] pressure, we should be able to switch the stripe magnet to a superconductor using relatively low pressures of a few kbars, if the sample is located at the stripe side of the critical region.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We indeed observed such a stripe magnet to superconductor transition at 1 kbar in a nonsuperconducting La 1.65 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.15 CuO 4, which has a marginally smaller Sr content than the samples shown in .	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This magnitude of pressure can be generated quite easily without any special facility.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Besides, in contrast with the hydrostatic pressure, the sample in the uniaxial experiments is covered by the piston cylinder only from the top and bottom and beam probes can reach the sample quite easily.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It could be possible therefore to carry out a variety of physical measurements, including angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), neutron diffraction etc., to trace the evolution from stripe magnet to superconductor continuously using the same piece of crystal.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In summary, we have discovered a substantially large in-plane anisotropic uniaxial pressure effect on T c in La 1.64 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.16 CuO 4 , located at the critical vicinity to the (static) stripe-superconductivity boundary.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This result implies very strong coupling between the stripe formation and the anisotropic lattice distortion.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The charge ordered state, a self organization of electrons, has a lower symmetry than that of the original lattice and is stabilized by coupling to the lattice.	0
JPS0731123-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In this sense, what we have observed in La 1.64 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.16 CuO 4 should be universal to charge ordered systems in general.	0

EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The existence of a pseudogap in electronic excitation spectra of high-T c superconductors (HTSC), which appears below a certain temperature T* > T c, is considered to be amongst the most important features of cuprates.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Many experiments have provided evidence (NMR , angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) , specific heat , electron-tunneling spectroscopy and STM ) for a gap-like structure in electronic excitation spectra.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	There is a consensus on that the pseudogap is a characteristic feature of the underdoped regime of copper-oxides, and the value of T* increases with the decrease of hole concentration.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For example, in tunneling measurements on underdoped Bi2212 single crystals by STM, the pseudogap was detected even at room temperature .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	At the same time, tunneling measurements showed that the pseudogap is also present in slightly overdoped samples as well .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	An advantage of tunneling spectroscopy is that it is particularly sensitive to the density of state (DOS) near the Fermi level E F and, thus, is capable of detecting any gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum at E F .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In addition to this, tunneling spectroscopy has a high energy resolution .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In general, the pseudogap in cuprates can originate from the charge-densitywave (CDW) order, the spin-density-wave (SDW) order due to local antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations, the presence of incoherent Cooper pairs, or from their combination (so-called Ansatz) .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From earlier studies, the pseudogap was associated with a SDW gap due to local AF correlations .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Very recent measurements of high-frequency conductivity that track the phasecorrelation time in the normal state of underdoped Bi2212 showed that the incoherent Cooper pairs remain up to T pair which is well above T c , however, lower than T* .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, between T c and T pair , there is a contribution of incoherent Cooper pairs to the pseudogap.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Indeed, there is a consensus on that, to the contrary to conventional SCs, the formation of the Copper pairs and the establishment of the phase coherence among them in cuprates occur at different temperatures, T pair > T c .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	So, it is reasonable to expect that the incoherent Cooper pairs have to be observed above T c in different types of measurements including tunneling.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The T pair scales with T*, thus, the difference between T pair and T c is the highest in the underdoped regime and becomes smaller in the overdoped regime .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We present here direct measurements of the density of states by electrontunneling spectroscopy on slightly overdoped Bi2212 single crystals using a break-junction technique.	0

EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	shows a set of normalized tunneling conductance curves measured in superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) between 14 K and 290 K on an overdoped Bi2212 single crystal with T c = 88.5 K. All curves, except the last one, show a gaplike structure.	1
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In the absence of generally accepted model for the pseudogap, we consider the presence of the gap-like features in tunneling spectra as a sign of the pseudogap (for more details, see Ref. ).	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	There is no sign indicating at what temperature the superconducting gap was closed.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Across T c , the superconducting tunneling spectra evolve continuously into a normalstate quasiparticle-gap structure which vanishes at 232 K < T * < 290 K but remains almost unchanged with temperature up to 232 K .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Such evolution of superconducting spectra into normal-state spectra across T c has been also observed in superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) junctions .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, it is clear that the pseudogap is related somehow to the superconductivity .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The spectra in show the change in conductance from very low to high temperatures.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is difficult in such scale to see the differences between spectra above T c .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, shows tunneling spectra only above T c , measured on another overdoped Bi2212 single crystal with T c = 88 K. In , one can see that there is a gap-like structure just above T c which disappears at some temperature T 0 much lower than T*. Most pseudogap data observed in our study look similar to the data presented in , however, measurements on the best samples show some gap-like features in tunneling spectra above T c, which look similar to the gap-like structure shown in .	1
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Therefore, we believe that these features reflect intrinsic properties of overdoped Bi2212.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The spectra shown in are asymmetrical about zero bias.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Such behavior is typical for tunneling spectra obtained on the nonmetallic surfaces .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In fact, the contribution of the Cooper pairs to the pseudogap must not depend on the direction of bias.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, it is more convenient to consider only an even part of the conductivity, G e (V) ≡ [G(V) + G(-V)]/2 .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	shows the even part of the tunneling spectra presented in , one can clearly observe two humps at different temperatures, one of them disappears at T 0 > 100 K, and the second one is traceable up to high temperatures.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is difficult to indicate exactly the origins of these humps, especially, the wide ones which are traceable to high temperatures.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, we will try just to determine characteristic temperatures from temperature dependencies of these humps, which are shown in .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We use straight (dash) line in in order to estimate the value of T 0 which is of the order of 110 -115 K. The origin of this hump we discuss further.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We concentrate now on the behavior of the curve with dots in , which correspond to the temperature dependence of wide humps.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The fall of this curve with the increase of temperature between T c and T 0 supports an idea that there are some changes in the system.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The indication of some changes which begin at ~ 210 K with the increase of temperature can be explained by the disappearance of local AF correlations .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It seems that, between T 0 and 210 K, there is no principal changes in the system.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From Figs. 1, 2 and 3, the value of T * is of the order of 280 K. In , in addition to the two humps which have been discussed above, one can observe also a hump at 70 mV between 103 K and 122 K [18].	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We discuss now the origin of the contribution to the pseudogap, which disappears at T 0 with the increase of temperature.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	This contribution can be explained by the disappearance of the CDW or/and SDW order(s), or incoherent Cooper pairs.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	From the common sense, the CDW or SDW order is likely to be appear above T c and not to disappear.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Consequently, it is most likely that this contribution to the pseudogap is made by preformed pairs .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Tunneling spectroscopy is sensitive exclusively to the magnitude of the order parameter.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, if the humps originate from the presence of preformed pairs, then the magnitude of the gap-like structure reflects the average value of binding energy per particle .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	However, our results alone cannot prove that this contribution originates from preformed pairs.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We can argue that high-frequency conductivity measurements showed that the incoherent Copper pairs remain well above T c in Bi2212, and it was predicted by the theory .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	It is also in agreement with a MCS (Magnetic Coupling between Stripes) model proposed very recently .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	There is also an alternative explanation for the presence of this contribution to the pseudogap, it is possible that this contribution originates from the presence of the Bi2223 phase with T c = 110 K. Even in this case, our data obtained in SIS junctions support in general the conclusions made on the basis of tunneling data in SIN junctions, namely, that the pseudogap is directly related to superconductivity .	1
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Recently, the pseudogap has been observed in Bi2212 with T c = 90 K (optimum doping) and T c = 84 K (slightly overdoped) by SIN tunneling technique .	1
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The measured value of T* is equal to 300 K and 270 K, respectively.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, the value of T* ≈ 280 K found in our measurements for slightly overdoped single crystals is in an excellent agreement with the SIN tunneling measurements .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In slightly overdoped Bi2212, the pseudogap has been also observed in SIS tunneling measurements performed by breakjunction technique .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The value of T* is found to be of the order of 190 K. However, the analysis of SIS spectra presented in Ref.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	24 (see ) shows that, in fact, the T* value is of the order of 290 -300 K. In the literature, there is a clear discrepancy in the definition of T*. For slightly overdoped Bi2212, the temperature 270 -300 K corresponds most likely to the charge ordering, T* charge ≈ 270 -300 K .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The temperature T* ≈ 190 K found in Ref.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	and the changes which were observed at ~ 210 K in our study (see ) correspond most likely to the spin ordering, T* spin ≈ 190 -210 K .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Thus, there is a very good agreement among tunneling data presented in Refs.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	23, 24 and the present work.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	What is interesting, in SIS tunneling measurements, the value of 116 K has been also discussed and assumed to be the local onset of superconductivity .	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	In summary, we presented direct measurements of the density-of-state by tunneling spectroscopy on slightly overdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8-x single crystals in a temperature range between 14 K and 290 K using the break-junction technique.	0
EPL0490086-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	The pseudogap which has been detected above T c appears at T* ≈ 280 K. The fine analysis of the spectra shows that there is a contribution to the pseudogap above T c .	0

JPC0150L17-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	(ii) According to a model that describes the suppression of T c in Y 1−x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ , the number of supercarriers decreases linearly with increasing x in the range of 0.05 < x < 0.5, and consequently ∆n s /n s = −∆x/x.	0
JPC0150L17-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Moreover, for 0.1 < x < 0.5 the transition temperature T c decreases linearly with x, with ∆T c /∆x ≃ −150 K/Pr atom .	0

JPC0150L17-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	Assuming that the observed OIE on λ −2 ab is only due to a change of n s (∆m * ab /m * ab ≃ 0), one can estimate the corresponding shift of T c .	0
JPC0150L17-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	For x = 0.3 and x = 0.4 one finds ∆T c ≃ −1.8(4) K and −4.2(6) K, respectively.	0

JPC0150L17-CC.superconductors.tei.xml	We thus conclude that any change in n s during the exchange procedure must be small, and that the change of λ ab is mainly due to the OIE on the in-plane effective mass m * ab with ∆m * ab /m * ab ≃ 5(2) % and 9(2) % for x = 0.3 and x = 0.4, respectively.	0

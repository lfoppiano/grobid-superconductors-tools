<abstract><p>The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in many rare earth (RE) based intermetallic compounds has been extensively investigated during last two decades, not only due to their potential applications for magnetic refrigeration but also for better understanding of the fundamental problems of the materials. This paper reviews our recent progress of magnetic properties and MCE in some binary or ternary intermetallic compounds of RE with low boiling point metal(s) (Zn, <rs type="material">Mg</rs>, and Cd). Some of them are exhibiting promising MCE properties which make them also attractive for low temperature magnetic refrigeration. Characteristics of the magnetic transition, origin of large MCE as well as the potential application of these compounds were thoroughly discussed. Additionally, a brief review of the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties in the quaternary rare earth nickel boroncarbides RENi 2 B 2 C superconductors is also presented.</p></abstract>

<body><p>The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is a magneto-thermodynamic phenomenon which was first discovered in pure Fe by Emil Warburg in 1881, and its origin was independently explained by Debye and Giauque in the 1920s. All magnetic materials exhibit MCE, although the intensity of this effect depends on the properties of each material. Generally, for a simple ferromagnetic material near its Curie temperature, when a magnetic field is applied, the spins tend to align parallel to the magnetic field which lowers the magnetic entropy. To compensate for the loss in the magnetic entropy in an adiabatic (isentropic) process the temperature of the material increases. When the magnetic field is removed, the spins tend to become random which increases the magnetic entropy and the material cools. Meanwhile, Debye and Giauque have also proposed the adiabatic demagnetization in order to achieve temperature lower than that of the liquid helium. This possibility was later experimentally demonstrated by the chemist Nobel Laureate William F. Giauque in 1933, he was able to reach a temperature of <rs type="tcValue">0.25 K</rs> based on the adiabatic demagnetization of 61g paramagnetic salts <rs type="material">Gd 2</rs> (SO 4 ) 3 •8H 2 O. Besides the success in the ultralow temperature, the magnetic refrigeration technology has also been applied at the higher temperature ranges, such as ~<rs type="tcValue">2 to 20 K</rs>, the range of liquid helium and hydrogen, as well as ~<rs type="tcValue">20 to 80 K</rs>, the range of liquid hydrogen and nitrogen. In 1997, two key developments enhanced the feasibility for producing a magnetic refrigerator for commercial or industrial use. The first is that Zimm et al realized the first near room temperature magnetic refrigeration prototype at the Ames Laboratory. Second is that Pecharsky and Gschneider observed a giant MCE in the <rs type="material">Gd 5 (Si 2 Ge 2</rs> ) compound. Besides the discovery of the giant MCE in <rs type="material">Gd 5 (Si 2 Ge 2</rs> ) and related compounds, a number of materials with giant/large MCE have been realized in last three decades, for example <rs type="material">RECo 2 (RE = Er, Ho, and Dy)</rs> alloys, <rs type="class">MnAs based compounds</rs>, manganites (RE,M)MnO 3 , (RE = lanthanide, M = Ca, Sr, and Ba), Ni-Mn-X (X = Ga, In, and Sn) based Heusler alloys, <rs type="material">La(Fe,Si)</rs> and related compounds, MnTX (T = Co, Ni, and Fe; X = Si, Ge) based compounds as well as some rare earth (RE) based intermetallic compounds. The structure, physical properties as well as the MCE and its application in most of the above mentioned materials have been summarized in a number of reviews articles which will not be repeated here. In this paper, we give a brief review of our recent progress in exploring magnetocaloric materials, mainly related to several typical systems of RE-based intermetallic compounds.</p><p>The MCE is a intrinsic phenomenon for magnetic materials which manifests as the isothermal magnetic entropy change S M or/and the adiabatic temperature change T ad when it is exposed to a varying magnetic field, the definition of S M and T ad can be found in .</p><p>The MCE can be measured directly or it can be calculated indirectly from the experimentally measured heat capacity and/or magnetization. In the present review, the reported values of S M and T ad were estimated from two different methods using the indirect technology: (1) from field and temperature dependence of heat capacity C (H, T), (2) from field and temperature dependence of <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> M (H, T) and zero field heat capacity C (T, 0T) which were described as below:</p><p>The temperature dependence of total entropy S under different fields can be calculated from heat capacity by numerical integration: where H is the magnetic field at which the heat capacity was measured. Then the S M as well as the adiabatic temperature change T ad can be calculated from the heat capacity measurements using the following relations: According to thermodynamical theory, the isothermal magnetic entropy changes associated with a magnetic field variation is given by From the Maxwell's thermodynamic relation: one can obtain the following expression: where S, M, H, and T are the magnetic entropy, <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> of the material, applied magnetic field, and the temperature of the system, respectively. From the <rs type="me_method">magnetization measurements</rs> made at discrete field and temperature intervals, S M can be approximately calculated by the following expression: From zero field C (T), we can calculate S (T, 0 T) by using equation 1. Using the magnetic entropy change S M calculated from M (H, T), the S (T, H) can be calculated from the following expression: Then the adiabatic temperature change T ad can be calculated using Eq. 3. Using the present method, the accuracy of the S M calculated from the <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> data for the materials studied here is better than 10%.</p><p>Another important quality factor(s) for magnetocaloric materials is the relative cooling power (RCP) or/and refrigerant capacity (RC) which is a measurement of the amount of heat transfer between the cold and hot reservoirs in an ideal refrigeration cycle. The RCP is defined as the product of the maximum magnetic entropy change -S M max and full width at half Whereas, the RC is calculated by numerically integrating the area under the -S M -T curve at half maximum of the peak taken as the integration limits, where T 1 and T 2 are the temperatures of the cold end and the hot end of an ideal thermodynamic cycle, respectively, i.e., An example for the evaluation of the RCP and RC is displayed in . It is easy to find that the value of RC is around 25 % lower than that of the RCP for the S M (T) that with a single broad triangle peak around T C , which is a typical character for the second order MCE materials.</p><p>It is well known that the magnitude, temperature and magnetic field change dependence of MCE have strong correlation with the nature of the corresponding magnetic phase transition;</p><p>therefore, it is important to determine the order of magnetic transition of the magnetocaloric materials. Based on the Inoue-Shimizu model, which involves a Landau expansion of the magnetic free energy up to sixth power of the total <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> M, can be used to determine the magnetic transition type, After mimimization of the above equation with respect to the magnetization M, the <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> near the Curie temperature T C : The parameters c 1 (T), c 2 (T) and c 3 (T) represent the Laudau coefficient, and it has been reported that the order of a magnetic transition is related to the sign of the c 2 (T). A transition is expected to be the first order when c 2 (~T C ) is negative, whereas it will be the second order for a positive c 2 (~T C ). The sign of c 2 can be determined by Arrott plot (H/M versus M 2 curves) , i. e. the magnetic transition is of second order if all the H/M versus M 2 curves have positive slope.</p><p>On the other hand, if the H/M versus M 2 curves show negative slope, the magnetic transition is of the first order. In the present review, the order of magnetic phase transition of all the materials was determined by this method.</p><p>The <rs type="class">rare earth (RE) -transition metal (T) based</rs> systems have intensively been investigated in recent years with respect to their interesting chemical and physical properties as well as practical applications in a wide spectrum of industries. Depending on the constituent element and composition, various properties like magnetic ordering, superconductivity, <rs type="class">heavy-fermion</rs> behaviour, valence fluctuation, large magneto-resistance (MR) effect and large/giant MCE, etc. have been observed. Compared to the other transition metals, the research related to Zn, <rs type="material">Mg</rs>, and Cd-based intermetallic compounds are not too much. This might be a consequence of the difficulty in materials synthesis due to the low boiling point (high vapour pressure) of Zn, <rs type="material">Mg</rs>, and Cd. Pöttgen et al. have proposed a simple method to prepare such materials. First, stoichiometric amounts (0.5%~1% of the low boiling point metals were added) of the consistent elementals with purity better than 99.9% were weighted. Second, the weighted metals are arc-welded in a Ta or Nb tube under an argon pressure of ca. kPa. The argon was purified over titanium sponge (<rs type="tcValue">900 K</rs>), silica gel, and molecular sieves.</p><p>Third, the crucible was placed in a water-cooled sample chamber of an induction furnace (Hüttinger Elektronik, Freiburg, Germany, Typ TIG 1.5/300) and heated up to a certain high temperature for several minutes, following by several hours annealing at a selected temperature.</p><p>Then the obtained samples were grinded and cold-pressed into pellet, and finally annealed at a certain temperature for several days in evacuated quartz tubes. The structural properties and phase purity were subsequently characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analyses. In the following section, our recent progress related to the magnetism and MCE in the binary or ternary intermetallic compounds of RE with low boiling point metal(s) (Zn, <rs type="material">Mg</rs>, and Cd) is reviewed, respectively. For a quick comparison, the magnetic transition temperature together with MCE parameters for the compounds in the present review as well as some other rare earth based intermetallic compounds with significant MCE properties are summarized in .</p><ab type="figureCaption">The equiatomic binary compounds REZn (RE is a rare earth) with the cubic CsCl-type structure (space group Pm3m) have attracted some attention due to their simple crystal structure as well as their interesting physical and chemical properties. The magnetic studies revealed that the heavy REZn compounds order ferromagnetically with the ordering temperature ranging from <rs type="tcValue">267 K</rs> for <rs type="material">GdZn</rs> to <rs type="tcValue">8.5 K</rs> for <rs type="material">TmZn</rs>, whereas the light ones order antiferromagnetically. Sousa et al. have theoretically investigated the MCE in REZn (RE = Tb, Ho, and Er), and some anomalies in S M (T) curves are found due to spontaneous and/or spin reorientation transitions in these compounds. Very recently, we have experimentally investigated the magnetic phase transition and magnetocaloric properties of REZn (RE = Tm and Ho) compounds.</ab><p>shows the temperature dependence of the zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) magnetization (M) for <rs type="material">TmZn</rs> under various magnetic fields (H) from 0.1 to 1 T. Both ZFC and FC M(T) curves show a typical PM to FM transition. With increasing magnetic field, T C increases gradually from <rs type="tcValue">8.4 K</rs> for H = 0.1 T to <rs type="tcValue">10.3 K</rs> for H = 1 T. To evaluate the MCE in <rs type="material">TmZn</rs>, a set of M(H) curves with increasing and decreasing magnetic field up to 7 T together with the temperature dependence of the heat capacity C for <rs type="material">TmZn</rs> for the magnetic field changes of 0-2 and 0-5 T for <rs type="material">TmZn</rs> were measured. No obvious hysteresis can be observed for the whole temperature range. Several isotherms with increasing field are presented in and the corresponding Arrott plot (H/M versus M 2 ) curves are shown in . For the low temperature ones, the M(H) curves show the typical behavior of a soft ferromagnet. With increasing temperature higher than 8 K, a field induced metamagnetic transition can be observed in the M(H) curves with a wide temperature range, and resulting in a clear S-shape in the Arrott plots which is a typical characterization for the first-order magnetic phase transition. Additionally, the observed magnetic properties in <rs type="material">TmZn</rs> are quite similar to one of the most important class of MCE materials, RECo 2 (RE = Dy, Ho, and Er), which were highlighted due to the occurrence of IEM as well as its close relationship with giant MCE. The temperature dependence of -S M and T ad for TmZn are shown in . 6 and Fig. 7 which was calculated from the M (H, T) data and from C (T, H), respectively. Both S M and T ad obtained by using the two methods as described in Section 2 are in good agreement with each other. The values of -S M max are 26.9 and 29.7 J/kg K for the magnetic field changes of 0-5 and 0-7 T, respectively, and the corresponding values of are 8.6 and <rs type="tcValue">11.2 K</rs>, indicating that the binary equiatomic compound TmZn belongs to a class of giant magnetocaloric materials. Moreover, for the relatively small field change of 0-1 and 0-2 T, the values of -S M max reach 11.8 and 19.6 J/kg K which is beneficial for application. The observed giant MCE in TmZn is related to the first order, field-induced metamagnetic phase transition. I. e., the field sensitive magnetic transition, sharp changes of <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> around T C and large values of <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> of TmZn are considered to be the origin of the giant MCE. For the magnetic field changes of 0-2, 0-5 and 0-7 T, the values of RCP and RC are determined to be 76, 269 and 422 J/kg, and to be 59, 214 and 335 J/kg, respectively. The corresponding values of T ad max are estimated to be 3.3, 8.6 and <rs type="tcValue">11.2 K</rs>. These MCE parameters for TmZn (see ), especially for the magnetic field change of 0-2 T, are comparable or obviously larger than most of the potential promising magnetic refrigerant materials in the similar temperature region, the applicability of TmZn attractive for low temperature active magnetic refrigeration. Whereas, two successive magnetic transitions are observed around T C ~ <rs type="tcValue">72 K</rs> and T SR ~ <rs type="tcValue">26 K</rs> for HoZn which is corresponding to paramagnetic to ferromagnetic and spin reorientation transitions, respectively. Magnetization and modified Arrott plots indicate that <rs type="material">HoZn</rs> undergoes a second-order magnetic phase transition around T C . The critical behaviour around T C has been performed by modified Arrott plots, scaling analysis and scaling plots and field change dependence on the magnetic entropy change method. The values of critical exponents ,  and </p><ab type="figureCaption">for HoZn are determined to be 0.47±0.02, 1.09±0.03 and 3.32±0.04, respectively which have some small deviations from the mean-field theory, indicating a short range or a local magnetic interaction which is properly related to the coexistence of FM and SR transitions at low temperature. The magnetic entropy change S M for <rs type="material">HoZn</rs> was calculated from M (H, T) data (as shown in ). One large peak together with a shoulder can be observed in the -S M (T) curves around the FM and SR <rs type="tc">transition temperatures</rs>, respectively. Two peaks (shoulder) overlap with each other, resulting in a wide temperature range with a large RCP which is beneficial for active applications. The maximum values of the magnetic entropy change (-S M max ) of HoZn for the magnetic field changes of 0-2, 0-5 and 0-7 T are 6.5, 12.1 and 15.2 J/kg K, respectively. The corresponding values of RCP are evaluated to be as large as 255, 792 and 1124 J/kg. These values are obviously larger than those of recently reported for potential magnetic refrigerant materials with similar working temperature under the same field change (see ). The large values of -S M max and RC indicate that <rs type="material">HoZn</rs> could be a promising candidate for active magnetic refrigeration in the temperature range of <rs type="tcValue">30-90 K</rs>. Hermes et al. have studied the magnetic properties and MCE in the <rs type="material">EuRh 1.2 Zn 0.8</rs> which crystallizes with the <rs type="material">MgCu 2</rs> structure and orders ferromagnetically at T C ~ <rs type="tcValue">95 K</rs>. For the magnetic changes of 0-2 and 0-5 T, the values of -S M max , T ad max and RCP are evaluated to be 3.1 and 5.7 J/kg K, to be <rs type="tcValue">1.4 and 2.8 K</rs>, and to be 233 and 513 J/kg, respectively. A large reversible MCE was reported in EuAuZn around 52 K accompanied by a second order magnetic phase transition from a PM to a FM state. The values of -S M max for EuAuZn reach 4.8, 9.1 and 11.3 J/kg K for the magnetic field changes of 0-2, 0-5 and 0-7 T, respectively, and show no thermal and magnetic hysteresis around T C . The corresponding values of T ad max are evaluated to be <rs type="tcValue">2.1, 3.8 and 4.7 K</rs>. Very recently, Zhang et al. have reported the magnetic and</ab><p>magnetocaloric properties in the equiatomic intermetallic compounds of TmZnAl. And they found that the TmZnAl compound undergoes a second order magnetic transition from PM to FM state around <rs type="tcValue">2.8 K</rs>. A reversible MCE with considerable magnitude was observed at low temperature. For the magnetic field changes of 0-2, 0-5 and 0-7 T, the maximum values of -S M are 4.3, 9.4 and 11.8 J/kg K and the corresponding values RCP (RC) are determined to be 53 (41), 189 (149) and 289 (228) J/kg, respectively, for TmZnAl.</p><p>The ternary RE-rich intermetallic compounds of the general composition RE 4 TMg (T = Rh, Pd, or Pt), crystallizing in the cubic Gd RhIn-type structure have attracted some attention due to their interesting physical and chemical properties. For this type of crystal structure, there are three crystallographically independent RE sites and the rare structural motif of <rs type="material">Mg 4</rs> tetrahedra. The transition metal atoms are located in RE 6 trigonal prisms with strong covalent RE-T bonding. These RE 6 T basic building units are condensed via common corners and edges to a three-dimensional network in which the cavities are filled by the <rs type="material">Mg 4</rs> tetrahedra. Recently, we have reported the magnetic properties and MCE of RE 4 PdMg (RE = Eu and Er) and RE 4 PtMg</p><ab type="figureCaption">(RE = Ho and Er). The magnetic phase transition, the origin of the MCE and its potential application for magnetic refrigeration of these compounds will be shown as below.</ab><p>a) shows the temperature dependent ZFC and FC <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> M (left scale) and dM FC /dT (right scale) under H = 0.1 T for Eu 4 PdMg. No difference is observed between the ZFC and FC M-T curves around T C which is usual in magnetic materials with a second order magnetic transition. Only one peak in dM/dT vs. T is observed around <rs type="tcValue">150 K</rs> which is corresponding to the PM to FM magnetic transition. Figure 9 (b) shows the FC <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> M (left scale) and dM FC /dT (right scale) for Eu PdMg under H = 1 T. We can note that M increases continuously with decreasing temperature, and dM/dT shows a table-like behaviour from <rs type="tcValue">20 to 150 K</rs>. shows the M(T) curves for Eu 4 PdMg under various magnetic fields up to 7 T.</p><p>The magnetic transition is very sensitive to the magnetic field, a sharp PM to FM transition can be observed under low magnetic field, and the transition getting broader gradually with increasing magnetic field. The magnetization almost shows linear temperature dependence under higher magnetic fields. This exotic magnetic transition behaviour may be related to its special crystal structure and abundant rare earth site occupation. A set of magnetic isotherms were measured for Eu 4 PdMg in the temperature range from 3</p><p>to <rs type="tcValue">220 K</rs> to evaluate its magnetic entropy change. No obvious hysteresis can be observed over the temperature range. Additionally, the order of magnetic phase transition for Eu PdMg is confirmed to be second order based on the Banerjee criterion. The resulted -S M (T) curves with the magnetic field changes up to 0-7 T is shown in The -S M (T) curves show a pronounced peak around <rs type="tc">T C</rs> for a low magnetic field change which is similar to the typical behaviour for magnetocaloric materials with a single magnetic phase transition. A very broad table-like behaviour can be observed for a high magnetic field change which is beneficial for application. These peculiar MCE properties in <rs type="material">Eu 4</rs> PdMg are probably related to the magnetic field sensitive magnetic phase transition and large saturated magnetic moment which is corresponding to its exotic magnetic and/or crystal structure. With the magnetic field changes of 0-2, 0-5 and 0-7 T, the values of -</p><p>S M max are 2.6, 5.5 and 7.2 J/kg K, respectively. The corresponding values RCP (RC) are determined to be 53 (41), 189 (149) and 289 (228) J/kg. As a matter of fact, the values of -S M max are smaller than those of recently reported giant MCE materials at the low temperature region which is related to the additional internal entropy loss due to the larger lattice heat capacity of the materials with the higher T C . The -S M max value of Eu 4 PdMg is comparable with those of some potential magnetic refrigerant materials in the similar temperature region under the same field change (see table I). The RC and RCP values are obviously larger than those of some potential magnetic refrigerant materials at similar temperature region. The excellent MCE properties indicate that Eu 4 PdMg is a promising candidate for active magnetic refrigeration in the <rs type="tcValue">20 to 160 K</rs> temperature range. The present results may also provide an important clue for searching suitable refrigerant materials in the</p><ab type="figureCaption">category of materials that with a field sensitive magnetic phase transition(s). Very recently, the magnetic properties and the MCE in Ho 4 PtMg, Er 4 PdMg, and Er 4 PtMg compounds have been investigated by <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> and heat capacity measurements. The</ab><ab type="figureCaption">compounds undergo a second order magnetic phase transition from a PM to FM state at Curie temperatures of T C ~ 28, 21 and <rs type="tcValue">16 K</rs> for <rs type="material">Ho 4 PtMg, Er 4 PtMg, and Er 4 PdMg</rs>, respectively. The resulted temperature dependence of -S M and T ad with various magnetic field changes up to 0-7 T for Ho PtMg, Er 4 PdMg and Er PtMg are shown in Fig. 12 (a), (b) and (c), and in Fig. 13 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. With the magnetic field changes of 0-1, 0-2, 0-5 and 0-7 T, the values of -S M max are evaluated to be 2.8, 6.1, 13.4 and 16.9 J/kg K, to be 2.8, 6.2, 15.5 and 20.6 J/kg K, and to be 3.9, 8.5, 17.9 and 22.5 J/kg K for <rs type="material">Ho 4 PtMg, Er 4 PdMg and Er PtMg</rs>, respectively, indicating that the presently studied compounds belong to a class of large MCE materials. For the magnetic field changes of 0-2, 0-5 and 0-7 T, the values of RCP are determined to be 177, 527 and 762 J/kg; 142, 457 and 742 J/kg K; 152, 483 and 716 J/kg K for <rs type="material">Ho 4 PtMg, Er 4 PdMg and Er 4 PtMg</rs>, and the corresponding values of T ad max are evaluated to be <rs type="tcValue">1.8, 4.1 and 5.3 K</rs>, to be <rs type="tcValue">1.7, 3.7 and 5.5 K</rs>, and to be 2.2, 5.0 and <rs type="tcValue">6.5 K</rs>, respectively. The values for the presently studied compounds are comparable or even larger than some of the potential promising magnetic refrigerant materials in the similar temperature region, classifying them as considerable candidates for low temperature magnetic refrigeration. Linsinger et al. have studied magnetism and MCE in the Gd Ni</ab><p><rs type="material">x Cu 2-x Mg (x = 1 and 0.5)</rs> compounds. Both compounds show a large reversible MCE near their ordering temperatures. The values of -S M max reach 9.5 and 11.4 J/kg K for the field change of 0-5 T with no obvious hysteresis loss around <rs type="tcValue">65 K</rs> for <rs type="material">x = 0.5</rs> and x = 1, respectively. The corresponding values of RCP reach 688 and 630 J/kg which is relatively high compared to other MCE materials in that temperature range. These results indicate that <rs type="material">Gd 2 Ni x Cu 2-x Mg</rs> could be a promising system for magnetic refrigeration at temperatures below liquid N 2 . The values of T ad max for <rs type="material">Gd 2 Ni 0.5 Cu 1.5 Mg</rs> reach <rs type="tcValue">1.6 and 3.2 K</rs> for the magnetic field changes of 0-2 and 0-5 T, respectively, whereas T ad max for Gd 2 NiCuMg is slightly higher with <rs type="tcValue">1.8 K</rs> and <rs type="tcValue">4.3 K</rs>. Gorsse et al., have investigated the MCE in <rs type="material">Gd 4 Co 2 Mg</rs> compound. [70] They found that the compound orders antiferromagnetically below T N = <rs type="tcValue">75 K</rs> and shows a field-induced transition at approximately 0.93 T at <rs type="tcValue">6 K</rs>. The values of -S M max reach 5.8 and 10.3 J/kg K at <rs type="tcValue">77 K</rs> for the magnetic field changes of 0-2 and 0-4.6 T, respectively, which is related to the field-induced magnetic phase transition. The corresponding values of T ad max are 1.3(1) and 3.4(1) K, respectively.</p><ab type="figureCaption">Due to the high toxicity of Cd and its compounds, the Cd-based alloys and compounds have limited technical application, and there is little work on the related topics. Hermes et al. have investigated the magnetic and MCE properties in</ab><ab type="figureCaption">Er <rs type="material">NiCd</rs> compound which crystallizes in the Gd RhIn type structure. They found that Er NiCd shows Curie-Weiss behavior above <rs type="tcValue">50 K</rs> with T N = <rs type="tcValue">5.9 K</rs>. At field strength of 0.4 T a metamagnetic step is visible, together with the positive paramagnetic Curie-temperature (<rs type="tcValue">7.5 K</rs>) indicative for the rather unstable antiferromagnetic ground state. The values of S M max reach -7.3 and -18.3 J/kg K, and the resulted RCP are 237 and 595 J/kg, for the magnetic field changes of 0-2 and 0-5 T, respectively, for <rs type="material">Er 4 NiCd</rs>. The corresponding values of T ad max are 3.1 and <rs type="tcValue">7.7 K</rs> for the magnetic field changes of 0-2 and 0-5 T, respectively. These results indicate that Er 4 NiCd could be a promising system for magnetic refrigeration at temperatures below liquid H 2 . Recently, Li et al. have investigated the magnetism and MCE in GdCd</ab><p><rs type="material">1-x Ru x (x = 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2</rs>) solid solutions. Figure 14 shows the temperature dependence of ZFC and FC <rs type="me_method">magnetization</rs> for <rs type="material">GdCd 1-x Ru x</rs> under a low magnetic field of H = 0.1 T. A typical PM to FM transition can be observed around T C ~ 149, 108 and <rs type="tcValue">73 K</rs> for <rs type="material">x = 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2</rs>, respectively. No obvious thermal hysteresis can be observed between ZFC and FC M-T curves which is benefit for application. To evaluate the MCE in <rs type="material">GdCd 1-x Ru x</rs> , a set of M(H) curves around its own T C were measured. The resulted temperature dependence of -S M for <rs type="material">x = 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2</rs> are shown in Fig. 15 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. The -S M (T) curves show pronounced peaks around its own T C , and the peak is getting sharper and the peak temperature shifts to lower temperature gradually with increasing x. Interestingly, a table-like behaviour in -S M (T) curve for x = 0.1 can be observed which is benefit for application, especially for a single material. For the magnetic field changes of 0-2, 0-5 and 0-7 T, the values of -S M max are evaluated to be 1.8, 4.1 and 5.6 J/kg K; to be 2.4, 5.8 and 7.8 J/kg K; and to be 3.8, 8.5 and 11.0 J/kg K for <rs type="material">x = 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2</rs>, respectively. The -S M max as a function of magnetic field changeH 2/3 for <rs type="material">GdCd 1-x Ru x</rs> is shown in the inset of . Franco et al. have previously proposed a universal relation in a magnetic system with second-order phase transition between the -S M max and H, -S max ≈ A(H) n , where A is a constant. A linear relation between -S M max and (H) 2/3 can be observed for all the present studied samples under high magnetic field changes, indicating the critical behaviour for <rs type="material">GdCd 1-x Ru x</rs> is close to the mean field theory. For the magnetic field change of 0-5 T and 0 to 7 T, the values of RCP for <rs type="material">GdCd 1-x Ru x</rs> are determined 636, 597 and 583 J/kg, and to be 889, 852 and 828 J/kg for <rs type="material">x = 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2</rs>, respectively. Additionally, the <rs type="material">GdCd 1-x Ru x</rs> solid solutions are quite interesting, since by changing the Ru content, it can cover a wide temperature range with excellent MCE properties and then the materials can be combined to design a composite material used as a magnetic refrigerant. Therefore, the considerable S M max without any thermal/magnetic hysteresis and large RCP values together with the tunable T M indicate that the <rs type="material">GdCd 1-x Ru x</rs> solid solutions are attractive for active magnetic-refrigeration. [73]</p><p>The quaternary rare earth nickel boroncarbides RENi 2 B 2 C (RE = rare earth) which crystallize in the tetragonal LuNi 2 B 2 C-type structure have attracted much attention due to the coexisting of superconductivity and magnetic ordering phenomena. The compounds are long range magnetic ordered for RE = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm. And the superconductivity is observed for RE = Y, Lu, Dy, Ho, Er and Tm. I. e., superconductivity coexists with magnetic order for RE = Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm, and the <rs type="tc">ratio of superconducting transition temperature</rs> (T SC ) to antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering temperature T N ranges from T SC /T N = 7.0 for TmNi 2 B 2 C to 0.60 for <rs type="material">DyNi 2 B 2 C</rs> systems. The coexistence and competition of magnetism and superconductivity in these compounds have been systematically investigated experimentally and theoretically. In recent years, we have further investigated the MCE in parent and doped RENi 2 B 2 C superconductors. The main achievements will be shown in the following sections. The <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> and magnetic ordering temperatures together with MCE parameters are summarized in for a quick comparison of the MCE / 56 in the RENi 2 B 2 C superconductors. 4.1. Giant reversible MCE in <rs type="material">Dy 0.9 Tm 0.1 Ni 2 B 2 C</rs> superconductor Figure 16 shows the low temperature magnetic isothermals on increasing (open symbols) and decreasing (filled symbols) field for <rs type="material">Dy 0.9 Tm 0.1 Ni 2 B 2</rs> C at <rs type="tcValue">2 and 3 K</rs> as well for <rs type="material">DyNi 2 B 2</rs> C at <rs type="tcValue">2 K</rs> for a comparison. A large hysteresis for DyNi 2 B 2 C was observed, in contrast, the hysteresis of <rs type="material">Dy 0.9 Tm 0.1 Ni 2 B 2 C</rs> was ignorable for T ≥ 3 K. The magnetic phase transition T M</p><p>and <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> T SC are determined to be <rs type="tcValue">9.2 and 4.5 K</rs>, respectively, which are lower than those in <rs type="material">DyNi 2 B 2 C</rs>. A set of selected magnetic isothermals M(H) were measured to evaluate the MCE in <rs type="material">Dy 0.9 Tm 0.1 Ni 2 B 2 C</rs>. The M(H) curves were converted to the Arrot-plot of H/M vs. M 2 for <rs type="material">Dy 0.9 Tm 0.1 Ni 2 B 2 C</rs> at some selected temperatures which reveals the occurrence of a first order magnetic phase transition because there is a clear S-shaped</p><ab type="figureCaption">behavior below the transition temperature, based on the Banerjee criterion. The resulted magnetic entropy changes -S M which was calculated from M(H, T) curves in</ab><p>Tm 0.1 Ni 2 B 2 C as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 17. The temperature and magnetic field change dependences of -S M (T) curves provide valuable information on the magnetic ordering in <rs type="material">Dy 0.9 Tm 0.1 Ni 2 B 2</rs> C. For the magnetic field changes H ≤ 2 T, -S M is negative (inverse MCE) below the transition temperature, and changes to positive with increasing temperature, which is corresponding to the magnetic transition from PM to AFM state. For H ≥ 3 T, a positive -S M (i.e. conventional MCE) with a broad peak around <rs type="tcValue">13 K</rs> is observed. The values of maximum magnetic entropy change (-S M max ) reach 14.7 and 19.1 J/kg K for the magnetic field change of 0-5 and 0-7 T, respectively. The giant MCE was believed to be related to the field induced first-order magnetic transition from AFM to FM. The field dependence of -S M max for <rs type="material">Dy 0.9 Tm 0.1 Ni 2 B 2 C</rs> is also shown in the inset of The value of -S M max increases continuously with the increasing field, and a faster increase of -S M max with increasing field was observed above 2 T. I.e. the MCE could attain higher value in higher magnetic fields. The MCE parameters for <rs type="material">Dy 0.9 Tm 0.1 Ni 2 B 2 C</rs> are comparable with those of the potential promising magnetic refrigerant materials in the similar temperature region.</p><ab type="figureCaption">We have also investigated the superconductivity, magnetic properties and MCE in</ab><ab type="figureCaption"><rs type="material">x Ho x Ni 2 B 2 C (x = 0 -1)</rs> superconductors. The <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs> T SC and the magnetic ordering temperature T M are determined to be 6.4, 6.4, <rs type="tcValue">6.2, 8.1 and 8.2 K</rs> and to be 10, 8.5, 8, 6 and <rs type="tcValue">5 K</rs> for <rs type="material">x = 0, 03, 0.5, 0.7</rs> and 1, respectively. [105, 106] A set of selected magnetic isothermals on increasing and decreasing field for <rs type="material">Dy 1-x Ho x Ni 2 B 2 C (x = 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1)</rs> are measured in the temperature range from <rs type="tcValue">2 to 36 K</rs> up to 7 T. Although some hysteresis of M(H) can be observed at low temperatures, it gradually became smaller with increasing temperature, and almost disappeared above <rs type="tcValue">5 K</rs>. All the samples show similar behaviors. Several isotherms with increasing field for <rs type="material">x = 0.5</rs> are presented in Fig. 18(a). To understand the order of magnetic transition in <rs type="material">Dy 1-x Ho x Ni 2 B 2 C</rs>, the measured M-H isotherms were converted in to H/M versus M 2 plots. A clear negative slope at low temperature and low magnetic field region can be observed for all the compounds, the Arrott plots of <rs type="material">x = 0.5</rs> are shown in Fig. 18(b) for an example, indicating the first order magnetic phase transition for <rs type="material">Dy 1-x Ho x Ni 2 B 2</rs> C (x = 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1) compounds. The magnetic entropy change -S M was calculated from magnetization isotherm M (H, T)</ab><p>curves. The resulted temperature dependence of -S M is shown in Fig 19 for x = 0, 0.3, 0.7 and 1 and Fig. 20 (b) for <rs type="material">x = 0.5 in Dy 1-x Ho x Ni 2 B 2 C</rs>. The magnetic entropy change for <rs type="material">Dy 0.5 Ho 0.5 Ni 2 B 2 C</rs> were also calculated from the field and temperature dependence of heat capacity C (T, H) [(as shown in Fig. 20 (a)] using dT T are also shown in Fig. 20 (b). The results of entropy changes calculated from M (T, H) and C (T, H) are consistent with each other. For low magnetic field changes, -S M is negative (inverse MCE) below the transition temperature, and changes to positive with increasing temperature which can be understood in terms of the FM-AFM phase coexistence and the variation in the ratio of these phases under different magnetic fields. For the magnetic field changes of 0-5 and 0-7 T, a positive -S M (i.e. conventional MCE) with a broad peak can be observed. For the magnetic field changes of 0-2, 0-5 and 0-7 T, the maximum values of magnetic entropy change (-S M max ) are evaluated to be 4.5, 17.1 and 22.1 J/kg K for <rs type="material">x = 0</rs>; to be 7.3, 20.2 and 23.3 J/kg K for <rs type="material">x = 0.3</rs>; to be 5.9, 18.5 and 22.4 J/kg K for <rs type="material">x = 0.5</rs>; to be 6.3, 18.7 and 22.9 J/kg K for <rs type="material">x = 0.7</rs>; and to be 7.3, 19.2 and 22.3 J/kg K for <rs type="material">x = 1</rs>, respectively. [106] The large magnetic entropy changes in <rs type="material">Dy 1-x Ho x Ni 2 B 2 C</rs> are believed to be related to the field induced first-order magnetic transition from AFM to FM. The values of RCP are all keeping at same high values in the range of 45-62, 243-290 and 414-510 J/kg for the magnetic field changes of 0-2, 0-5 and 0-7 T, respectively. The values of -S M max and RCP for <rs type="material">Dy 1-x Ho x Ni 2 B 2 C (x = 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7</rs> and 1) are comparable with some of potential magnetic refrigerant materials reported in the same temperature range which indicate that the <rs type="material">Dy 1-x Ho x Ni 2 B 2</rs> C compounds could be promising candidates for low temperature magnetic refrigeration.</p><ab type="figureCaption">The magnetic properties and MCE in DyNi</ab><ab type="figureCaption"><rs type="class">2-x A x B 2 C (A = Co</rs> and Cr, <rs type="material">x = 0.1, and 0.2)</rs> compounds were also investigated.

To evaluate the MCE in</ab><p><rs type="class">DyNi 2-x A x B 2 C (A = Co</rs> and Cr, <rs type="material">x = 0.1 and 0.2</rs>), a set of magnetic isothermals are measured.

Several isotherms of DyNi 1.8 A 0.2 B 2 C for A = Co and Cr are presented in Fig. 22(a) and (b), and the corresponding Arrott-plot are presented in Fig. 22(c) and (d), respectively. Ni site Co or Cr substitution lower the magnetic transition temperature T M , and reduce the magnetic hysteresis of <rs type="material">DyNi B 2 C</rs>. The magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in <rs type="material">DyNi 2-x A x B 2 C (A = Co and Cr, x = 0.1, and 0.2)</rs> compounds have been studied. Ni site Co or Cr substitution lower the magnetic transition temperature T M , and reduce the magnetic hysteresis of DyNi 2 B 2 C. A clear negative slope at low temperature and low magnetic field region can be observed in Fig. 22 (c) and (d), indicating the first order magnetic phase transition for <rs type="material">DyNi 2-x A x B 2 C (A = Co and Cr, x = 0.1 and 0.2)</rs> compounds. The temperature and field dependences -S M for <rs type="material">DyNi 2-x A x B 2 C (A = Co and Cr, x = 0.1 and 0.2)</rs> were calculated based on the M(H, T) curves (as shown in ). For the magnetic field changes of 0-1 and 0-2 T, -S M is negative (inverse MCE) below the transition temperature, and changes to positive with increasing temperature, for the magnetic field changes of 0-5 and 0-7 T, a positive -S M (i.e., conventional MCE) can be observed. This behaviour is similar to that of <rs type="material">Dy 1-x Ho x Ni 2 B 2 C</rs> compounds which can be understood in terms of the FM and AFM phase coexistence and the variation in the ratio of these phases under different magnetic fields. For the magnetic field change of 0-2 T, the minimum and maximum values of -S M are evaluated to be -1.4 and 4.7 J/kg K for <rs type="material">DyNi 1.9 Co 0.1 B 2 C</rs>, to be -1.9 and 2.3 J/kg K for <rs type="material">DyNi 1.8 Co 0.2 B 2 C</rs>, to be -1.4 and 4.9 J/kg K for <rs type="material">DyNi 1.9 Cr 0.1 B 2 C</rs>, and to be -0.7 and 4.6 J/kg K for DyNi</p><p>1.8 Cr 0.2 B 2 C, / 56 respectively.

Similar to those of <rs type="material">DyNi 2-x A x B 2 C (A = Co and Cr, x = 0.1 and 0.2)</rs>, substitution of Fe for Ni lowered the magnetic transition temperature T M , and reduced the magnetic hysteresis of <rs type="material">ErNi 2 B 2 C</rs>. The inverse MCE under low magnetic field and at low temperatures is attributed to the nature of antiferromagnetic state for the present <rs type="material">ErNi 2-x Fe x B 2 C</rs> compounds. A normal MCE was observed under higher magnetic field changes, which is related to a field-induced first order metamagnetic transition from AFM to FM state.

[108] 5. Summary Investigations on MCE are of great interest for fundamental properties and technological application. Our recent progress of the magnetic properties and MCE as well as its origin and potential application for magnetic refrigeration in some rare earth based intermetallic compounds are reviewed, and some of them are possess excellent MCE properties. The main achievements are: 1) The <rs type="material">TmZn</rs> compound exhibits a ferromagnetic state below the Curie temperature of T C = <rs type="tcValue">8.4 K</rs>, and processes a field-induced metamagnetic phase transition around and above T C , resulting in a giant reversible MCE. Particularly, the values of -S M max reach 11.8 and 19.6 J/kg K for a low magnetic field changes of 0-1 and 0-2 T, respectively, indicating that TmZn could be a promising candidate for low temperature and low field magnetic refrigeration. 2) A single phased Eu PdMg compounds was synthesised by induction melting of the elements in a sealed tantalum tube in a water-cooled sample chamber. Eu 4 PdMg has a very magnetic field sensitive magnetic phase transition, resulting in a reversible, table-like MCE over a broad temperature range. Additionally, the RCP values are obviously larger than those of some potential magnetic refrigerant materials at similar temperature region, making Eu 4 PdMg attractive for magnetic refrigeration from <rs type="tcValue">20 to 160 K</rs>. 3) The <rs type="material">GdCd 1-x Ru x solid solutions with x = 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2</rs> have been successfully synthesized and the magnetism and MCE have been investigated. The samples undergo a second order magnetic phase transition from a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic state at Curie temperatures of T C ~ 160, 108 and <rs type="tcValue">73 K</rs> for <rs type="material">x = 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2</rs>, respectively. A large reversible MCE with a wide temperature range in <rs type="material">GdCd 1-x Ru x</rs> solid solutions was observed which make the <rs type="material">GdCd 1-x Ru x</rs> solid solutions considerable for active magnetic-refrigeration. 4) The Tm substitution effectively reduces the thermal hysteresis of <rs type="material">DyNi 2 B 2 C</rs>, therefore, a giant reversible MCE has been observed in antiferromagnetic superconductor <rs type="material">Dy 0.9 Tm 0.1 Ni 2 B 2</rs> C which is related to a field-induced first order metamagnetic transition from AFM to FM state. 5) The magnetic transition temperature T M as well as the temperature of -S M max in antiferromagnetic superconductors <rs type="material">Dy 1-x Ho x Ni 2 B 2 C</rs> gradually shifts to low temperature with increasing x, while the values of -S M max remain at almost the same high value which make the <rs type="material">Dy 1-x Ho x Ni 2 B 2</rs> C compounds attractive for active magnetic-refrigeration for low temperature magnetic refrigeration. The present results may provide some valuable information for searching proper magnetic materials for low temperature magnetic refrigeration.</p><p>[108] Zhang Y K and Yang B J J.

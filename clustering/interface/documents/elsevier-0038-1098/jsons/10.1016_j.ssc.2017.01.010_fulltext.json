Taking dT N /dP=−4.5 K GPa −1 for LaFe 12 B 6 system, the critical pressure for the disappearance of the antiferromagnetic order is estimated to be 8 GPa by a linear extrapolation to T N =0 K. As demonstrated in our recent papers , at finite tempera- tures, both AFM and PM states can be transformed into a ferromag- netic (FM) state via a field-induced transition.

"YBCO","YBCO","","","","","","","91.7 K","","simple","<body>","","In addition, subsequent heat treatments at 820Â°C and 925Â°C yielded phase pure YBCO nanowires with superconducting transition, T c = 91.7 K. Ultimately, the synthesis can be improved to obtain nanowires composed of single grains, thereby leading to an improvement of super- conducting properties due the reduction of grain boundaries. "

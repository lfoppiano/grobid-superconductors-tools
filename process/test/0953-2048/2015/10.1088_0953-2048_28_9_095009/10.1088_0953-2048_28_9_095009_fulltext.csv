"Ti5-20% doped MgB bulks","","Ti5-20","","","","","","13 K","","simple","<header>","<abstract>","The trapped field, which was obtained by field-cooled magnetization, B T FC , was about 3.6 T at 13 K at the surface of the single Ti5-20% doped MgB bulks, which was about 1.3 times larger than that of the non-doped bulk.

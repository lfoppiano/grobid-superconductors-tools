"NbN- SBA-15","","NbN- SBA-15","","","","","","13-14 K","","crf","<body>","<figure>","This confirms the very continuous nature of the superconducting transition in NbN- SBA-15, and together with the magnetization data suggests that the 1D character in this composite material is preserved down into the low-temperature regime without any establishment of global phase coherence in the nanowire arrays. "
"NbTi","","NbTi","","","Alloys","","","16 K","","crf, simple","<body>","<paragraph>","NbN is almost as important in superconducting applications as NbTi and has similar characteristics with a maximum transition temperature of 16 K [46], a short coherence length of 6.5 nm and an upper critical field of 15 T .

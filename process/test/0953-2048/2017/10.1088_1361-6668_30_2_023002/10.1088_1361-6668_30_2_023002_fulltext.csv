"Nb 3 Sn","","Nb 3 Sn","","","Alloys","","","4.2 K","","simple","<body>","<paragraph>","Nb 3 Sn is a superconductor with higher critical temperature, higher critical magnetic field and lower R s (T) in comparison with pure Nb, potentially allowing high gradient operation at 4.2 K also with high frequency cavities, opening the way to considerable cost reduction in SC linacs construction and operation.

"REBCO","REBCO","","","","","","","77 K","","simple","<body>","<paragraph>","This means although there are large thermal strains on all the domains at 77 K as listed in table 4, because the REBCO contracts almost isotropically, any change in T c associated with a large local thermal strain in the a-direction of any unit cell (in either domain) is compensated for by an equal and opposite change in T c associated with the equally large thermal strain in the b- direction.

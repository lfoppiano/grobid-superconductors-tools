"Nb 3 Al","","Nb 3 Al","","","Alloys","","","18.0 K","","simple","<body>","<paragraph>","For comparison, the M-T curve of Nb 3 Al wires prepared in NIMS is also added. be seen that 186# has better flux pinning properties than 184# at all temperatures, although they possess nearly the same T c , about 18.0 K. Considering that there is a much stronger diamagnetic signal and weaker second super- conducting transition in 186# than in 184# (see in figure ), the excellent flux pinning properties in 186# should be attributed to more stoichiometric Nb 3 Al superconductor and finer grains.

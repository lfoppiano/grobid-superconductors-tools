"Zr 5 Sb 3","","Zr 5 Sb 3","","","Alloys","","","2.3 K","","crf, vicinity","<body>","<paragraph>","Superconductivity has been reported firstly in Zr 5 Sb 3 with T c â¼2.3 K, and later in the Ru-doped Zr Sb 3 and Hf 5 Sb 3 (with structure changing from Mn 5 Si 3 type to W 5 Si 3 type upon doping). "
"Zr 5 Pt 3","","Zr 5 Pt 3","","","Alloys","","","7.2 K","","crf, simple","<body>","<paragraph>","As Zr 5 Pt 3 is also superconducting at a higher temperature with a T c at 7.2 K, one may expect that the superconducting trans- ition temperature will continue to increase if further doping studies are successful. "
"Zr Ge 2 Pt","","Zr Ge 2 Pt","","","Alloys","","","2.6 K","","crf, simple","<body>","<paragraph>","The normalized resistivity data is shown in figure (a), with all the Pt doped samples showing a clear super- conducting transition at low temperature, and the transition temperature of each sample increasing as the doping level increases from 2.6 K in Zr 5 Ge 2.8 Pt 0.2 to 3.5 K in Zr Ge 2 Pt, shown in figure 5(b).

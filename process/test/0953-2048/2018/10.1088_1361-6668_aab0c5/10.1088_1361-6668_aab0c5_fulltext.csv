"BaCuO 2","","BaCuO 2","","","Cuprates, Oxides","","","10 K","","simple","<body>","<paragraph>","The observed transition at â¼10 K is assigned to the Neel transition temperature (T N ) of the anti- ferromagnetic BaCuO 2 impurity phase , which manifests as the bump in the FC-M(T) curves of the 39 nm sample. "
"BaCO 3","","BaCO 3","","","Carbides, Oxides","","","20 K","","simple","<body>","<paragraph>","In figure 3(a), the ZFC curves of the 34 nm sample show a negative M from 100 K to â¼20 K, which is attributed to the diamagnetic signal of BaCO 3 [33]. "

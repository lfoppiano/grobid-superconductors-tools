"MgB 2","","MgB 2","","","Borides, Alloys","","","39 K","","vicinity","<body>","<paragraph>","The superconducting transition temperature (T c ) of the ultrathin NbN films used in HEB mixers is close to 11 , and this has limited the operational temperature of the NbN based HEB mixers to around 4.2 K. Owing to its high T c (â¼39 K) [5] and short electron-phonon interaction time (few picoseconds) , and fast phonon escape rate, MgB 2 has become a promising candidate for wideband HEBs with good sensitivity and higher operational temperatures.

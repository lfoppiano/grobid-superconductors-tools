"Bi-2212","","Bi-2212","","","","","","81 K","","crf, simple","<body>","<paragraph>","The doping rates were calculated from the T c values obtained from figure 7(a), according to the universal correlation between Tc and p given by the well-known formula Here T c max was taken to be 81 K for the Bi-2212 whiskers, as a result of systematic studies on their doping level by Inomata et al .

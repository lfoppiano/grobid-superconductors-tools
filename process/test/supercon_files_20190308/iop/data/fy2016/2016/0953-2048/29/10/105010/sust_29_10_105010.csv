"YBCO films doped with BSO","YBCO","","","films","","","","89.8 K","","simple","<body>","<paragraph>","The total thickness of the films was measured using a step height profiler (Dektak). Î¸ï =ï 0Â°and 90Â°correspond to B/c and B/ab. T c ï =ï 87.3-89.8 K and J c (77 K, 0 T)ï >ï 2 MA cm â2 in table 1 indicate that the sample quality of the MLs is a reasonable level for the YBCO films doped with BSO [5]. "

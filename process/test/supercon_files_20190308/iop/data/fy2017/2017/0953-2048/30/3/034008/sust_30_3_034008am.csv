"MgB 2","","MgB 2","","","Borides, Alloys","","","39 K","","crf","<body>","<paragraph>","Superconductivity in magnesium-diboride (MgB 2 ) was discovered in 2001 and today its industrial production offers a viable candidate for the design of large-scale applications operating at temperatures between 4.2 K and 20 K. "

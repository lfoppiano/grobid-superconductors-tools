"Ba-122","Ba-122","","","","","","","37 K","","simple","<body>","<paragraph>","No significant difference in the magnetization vs temperature curves measured by a SQUID magnetometer was observed between the Ag and Ag-Sn sheathed tapes, all samples showing the onset of transition at around 37 K. SEM-EDX analysis for Ba-122 core showed no observable signal of the Sn above the back ground level even near the interface within the resolution of the SEM. "
